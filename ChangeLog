Tue Jan 28 12:56:24 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Add libg++.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: fix clean-info, add flex.  add
	  fileutils.

	* configure: be less sensitive to spaces in Makefile.in.  Do not
	  look for sources in "..".  Doing so breaks subdirectories that
	  might have their own configure.  If a subdir has it's own
	  configure script, use it.

Mon Dec 16 23:05:19 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	  configure.

	  install.  clean-gdbm on clean.  infodir belongs in datadir.

	  install it.

Mon Dec  9 16:48:33 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix for bad directory tests.

Sat Dec  7 00:17:01 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* configure: \{1,2\} appears to be a sysv'ism.  Use a different
	  regexp.  -srcdir relative was being handled incorrectly.

	* Makefile.in: unwrapped some for loops so that parallel makes
	  work again and so one can focus one's attention on a particular
	  package.

Fri Dec  6 00:22:08 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* configure: added PWD as a stand in for `pwd` (for speed). use

	  in ${srcdir}.

	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.

Fri Nov 22 07:38:11 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Freshly created ChangeLog.
