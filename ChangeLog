Tue Jan 28 23:51:07 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  For libg++, make sure the -I pointing
	to the gcc directory goes *after* all the libg++-local -I flags.
	Also, move just-gcc dependency from just-libg++ to all-libg++.

Tue Jan 28 12:56:24 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* configure:  Change -x to -f to keep Ultrix /bin/test happy.

Sat Jan 18 17:45:11 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

Sat Jan 18 17:03:21 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	* config.sub:  Add stratus configuration frags.  Also 
	submitted to FSF.

Sat Jan 18 15:35:29 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (AR_FLAGS):  Make quieter.

Thu Jan  2 22:57:12 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Add libg++.
	* configure:  When verbose, don't output the command line at each
	level; it will be unremarkably the same as the previous version,
	which will be the same as what the user typed.

Fri Dec 27 16:26:47 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: fix clean-info, add flex.  add
	  fileutils.

	* configure: be less sensitive to spaces in Makefile.in.  Do not
	  look for sources in "..".  Doing so breaks subdirectories that
	  might have their own configure.  If a subdir has it's own
	  configure script, use it.

Thu Dec 26 16:30:26 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* cfg-paper.texi: some changes suggested by rms.

Thu Dec 26 10:13:36 1991  Fred Fish  (fnf at cygnus.com)

	taken from the gcc distribution, to bring the Cygnus and FSF
	versions into closer sync.

Mon Dec 16 23:05:19 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* configure, config.subr, config.sub: config.subr is now
	  config.sub again.

Fri Dec 13 01:17:06 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* configure.texi: new file, in progress.

	* Makefile.in: build info file and install the man page for
	  configure.

	* configure.man: new file, first cut.

	  has gone.  removed all traces of the -ansi option.  removed all
	  traces of the -languages option.

Wed Dec 11 22:25:20 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	  config.subr.

	* Makefile.in: BISON now bison -y again.  also install-gcc on
	  install.  clean-gdbm on clean.  infodir belongs in datadir.
	  Make directories for info install.  Build dir.info here then
	  install it.

Mon Dec  9 16:48:33 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix for bad directory tests.

Sat Dec  7 00:17:01 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* configure: \{1,2\} appears to be a sysv'ism.  Use a different
	  regexp.  -srcdir relative was being handled incorrectly.

	* Makefile.in: unwrapped some for loops so that parallel makes
	  work again and so one can focus one's attention on a particular
	  package.

Fri Dec  6 00:22:08 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	  Makefile now at top of generated Makefile.  Removed cvs log
	  entries.  added -srcdir.  create .gdbinit only if there is one
	  in ${srcdir}.

	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.

Fri Nov 22 07:38:11 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)
