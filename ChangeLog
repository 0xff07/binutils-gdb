	* configure: \{1,2\} appears to be a sysv'ism.  Use a different
	  regexp.  -srcdir relative was being handled incorrectly.

	* Makefile.in: unwrapped some for loops so that parallel makes
	  work again and so one can focus one's attention on a particular
	  package.

	* configure: added PWD as a stand in for `pwd` (for speed). use
	  elif wherever possible.  make -srcdir work without -objdir.
	  -objdir= commented out.

	* configure: +options become --options.  -subdirs commented out.
	  added -host, -datadir.  Renamed -destdir to -prefix.  Comment in
	  Makefile now at top of generated Makefile.  Removed cvs log
	  entries.  added -srcdir.  create .gdbinit only if there is one
	  in ${srcdir}.

	* Makefile.in: idestdir and ddestdir go away.  Added copyrights
	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.
