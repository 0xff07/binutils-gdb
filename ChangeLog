Sat Nov  7 18:52:27 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Replace C++ in macro names with CXX.

	in FLAGS_TO_PASS and TARGET_FLAGS_TO_PASS.

	Mon Sep  7 22:34:42 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cirdan.cygnus.com)

        given host and target

	* Makefile.in:  Add COPYING.LIB to GDB releases, now that there's

Tue Sep 29 14:11:18 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added -nostdinc to XTRAFLAGS if we are using gcc
	from the same source tree and not building a cross-compiler.  This
	matters for the libg++ configuration if reconfiguring a tree that
	has already been installed.

Sep 20 08:53:10 1992  Fred Fish  (fnf@cygnus.com)

	* config.sub (i486v/i486v4):  Merge in from FSF version.

	* configure: only set PWD if it is already set.

Thu Sep 17 23:05:53 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure: just set PWD=`pwd` at the top, since Ultrix sh
	doesn't have unset and all success paths (and most error paths)
	out set it anyway. (Note: should change all uses of ${PWD=`pwd`}
	to just ${PWD} to avoid confusion.)

Tue Sep 15 16:00:54 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* configure: always set $(tooldir) to $(libdir)/$(target_alias),
	even for a native compilation.

Tue Sep 15 02:22:56 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Changes to make the gdb.tar.Z rule work better.

	pick up the machine and system specific header files.

	* configure.in, config.sub: added new target m68010-adobe-scout,
	with alias of adobe68k.  Changed configure.in to check for
	-scout before -sco* to avoid a false match.

	* Makefile.in: added AS_FOR_TARGET, passed down in
	TARGET_FLAGS_TO_PASS.  Added CC_FOR_BUILD, which is intended to be
	the C compiler to use to create programs which are run in the
	build environment, set it to default to $(CC), and passed it down
	in FLAGS_TO_PASS and TARGET_FLAGS_TO_PASS.

Wed Sep  9 12:21:42 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added TARGET_FLAGS_TO_PASS, CC_FOR_TARGET,
	AR_FOR_TARGET, RANLIB_FOR_TARGET, NM_FOR_TARGET.  Pass

	  other than "." AND verbose.

	* configure: remove -s, rework -v to better accomodate guested
	  configures.

Tue Apr 21 12:31:33 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* configure: correct final line of config.status.

	* configure: patch from eggert.  Avoids a protection problem if
	  the original Makefile.in is read only.

	* configure: use move-if-change from gcc to create config.status.
	  Some makefiles depend on config.status to tell if a directory
	  has been reconfigured for a different host.  This change
	  prevents those directories from remaking everything in the case
	  where the reconfig was only intended to rebuild a Makefile.

	* configure: test for config.sub with "config.sub sun4" rather
	  than "config.sub ${host_alias}".  Otherwise we can't tell a bad
	  host alias from a missing config.sub.

Mon Apr 20 18:16:36 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: explicitly pass CFLAGS on recursion. no longer pass

	  definitions are not inherited.

	* configure: correct makesrcdir when subdir is .

Tue Apr 14 11:56:09 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* configure:  Add support for 'subdirs' variable, which is
	like 'configdirs', except that configure doesn't re-invoke
	itself for subdirs, it just creates a Makefile for each subdir.
	* configure.texi:  Document subdirs.

Mon Apr 13 18:50:16 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

Tue Apr  7 16:48:20 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* config.sub:  Don't canonicalize os value
	newsos* to bsd (readline needs to check for newsos).
	(This fix was earlier made Jan 31, but got re-broken.)

Mon Apr  6 14:34:08 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  sco is an os, not a vendor!

	* configure:  Quote $( better.  Keep various shells happy.

Tue Mar 31 16:32:57 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: drop flex.  make stamp files work.

	* configure: added test for conflicting configuration in srcdir,
	  remove trailing slashes from srcdir.  Otherwise emacs gdb mode
	  gets cranky.  use relative paths for configure and srcdir

	  going to stdout.

Tue Mar 10 18:01:55 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Fix libg++ rule to check for gcc directory
	before using gcc/gcc.  Also pass XTRAFLAGS.

	  when they are already built.

	* configure.texi: fixed a node pointer problem.

Thu Mar  5 12:05:58 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	the number of copies of COPYING that go into the GDB tar file.

Thu Jan 30 16:17:30 1992  Stu Grossman  (grossman at cygnus.com)

	* bfd/configure.in, config/mh-sco, gdb/config/mh-i386sco,
	gdb/config/mt-i386v32, gdb/configure.in, readline/configure.in:
	Fix SCO configuration stuff.

Tue Jan 28 23:51:07 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: fix clean-info, add flex.  add
	  fileutils.

	* configure: be less sensitive to spaces in Makefile.in.  Do not

	  install it.

Mon Dec  9 16:48:33 1991  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix for bad directory tests.

	* configure: \{1,2\} appears to be a sysv'ism.  Use a different
	  regexp.  -srcdir relative was being handled incorrectly.

	* Makefile.in: unwrapped some for loops so that parallel makes
	  work again and so one can focus one's attention on a particular
	  package.

	* configure: added PWD as a stand in for `pwd` (for speed). use
	  elif wherever possible.  make -srcdir work without -objdir.
	  -objdir= commented out.

	* configure: +options become --options.  -subdirs commented out.
	  added -host, -datadir.  Renamed -destdir to -prefix.  Comment in
	  Makefile now at top of generated Makefile.  Removed cvs log
	  entries.  added -srcdir.  create .gdbinit only if there is one
	  in ${srcdir}.

	* Makefile.in: idestdir and ddestdir go away.  Added copyrights
	  and shift gpl to v2.  Added ChangeLog if it didn't exist. docdir
	  and mandir now keyed off datadir by default.
