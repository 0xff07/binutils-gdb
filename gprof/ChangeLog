	* Makefile.in: created info, install-info, dvi

	* Makefile.in: fix install rule for $(PROG)

Fri Oct  9 11:25:41 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

        * gprof.1: updated SYNOPSIS to match actual behavior.

Mon Oct  5 17:50:16 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* gen-c-prog.awk:  New awk script, lightly changed from
	previously deleted make-c-prog.awk.  Converts a text file
	to a c function that prints that text.
	* flat_bl.m, fsf_callg_bl.m, bsd_callg_bl.m:  New files.
	Inputs to gen-c-prog.awk, containing text describing
	gprof output.
	* blurbs.c:  Removed.  Use *_bl.c instead.
	* Makefile.in: Use gen-cprog.awk to generate *_bl.c files
	from *_bl.m files.  Also, improve *clean rules.
	* printgprof.c (printgprof):  Usw new function names from *_bl.c.

	* gprof.h, gprof.c, printfgprof.c:  Add support for two
	output styles:  The default is similar to the old FSF gprof,
	while -T sets the variable bsd_style_output, which causes
	output matching Berkeley's gprof.  The biggest differences
	are that with the FSF style output, the flat profile comes
	before the call graph; numbers come before explanations;
	and there is less gratuitous white space.
	* gprof.h, gprof.c, printfgprof.c:  New discard_underscores
	variable causes discarding of initial underscores when
	printing symbol names.  It is set unless there is a "main"
	symbol (without an underscore).
	* printfgprof.c:  New function printnameonly(), called
	by printname().  It handles stripping of initial '_',
	as well as C++ name-demangling.
	* gprof.callg, gprof.flat, make-c-prog.awk:  Removed.
	It is just as convenient to edit blurbs.c directly.
	* Makefile.in:  Removed rule for making blurbs.c.
	* blurbs.c:  This is now a true source file (as opposed
	to being generated from gprof.callg and gprof.flat).
	Change style to use one long string literal, instead of
	one literal per output line.  Add FSF-style blurb for call graph.

Wed Aug 19 14:36:39 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: always create installation directories.

Wed Aug 12 15:14:14 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: change ${MACHINE} to $(MACHINE).

Sun Jul 19 17:34:01 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  removed installation of the now useless
	call.{flag,callg} files.  

	* gprof.1: now uses the standard man macros instead of the new BSD
	mandoc macros. 

Sun Jul 12 19:06:00 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Remove host section, expand target section.
	* config/mt-{tahoe,vax}:  Add, to match existing support files.
	* config/tmake-*:  Remove leftover crud.

	* blurbs.c:  New file, created from gprof.flat and gprof.callg by
	* make-c-prog.awk:  which processes text files into C programs.
	* printgprof.c (flatprofheader, gprofheader):  Call new functions
	to print blurbs.
	(printblurb):  Remove.
	* Makefile.in:  Infrastructure to build blurbs.
	* pathnames.h:  has been removed.  Gprof now has no filename
	dependencies in it.
	* gprof.c:  Lint.

Sat Jul 11 18:07:21 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: define man1dir and install the man page

Fri Jul 10 21:14:08 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn (zoo@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added dummy info and install-info targets

Thu Jun  4 11:34:02 1992  Mark Eichin  (eichin at cygnus.com)

	* lookup.c: fixed fencepost in nllookup and added dbg_nllookup for
	help in debugging the problem (with -DDEBUG)
	* gprof.c: symbol values are now real values, don't add the vma
	anymore. (done for solaris; should verify this on other platforms)
	* ChangeLog: created.
