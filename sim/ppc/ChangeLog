Thu Nov  2 08:54:04 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Rewrite --enable-sim switch handling to use the
	autoconf builtins so it works correctly if the configure or
	Makefile.in files are modified and make decides to rebuild
	Makefile.  Also document all of the --enable-sim switches
	supported.  Check whether getrusage and sys/resource.h are
	supported.
	* config.in: Regenerate.
	* configure: Regenerate.
	* Makefile.in: Add support for all of the variables set with
	--enable-sim switches.

	* Makefile.in (clean): make clean now removes all built sources as
	well.
	
	* cpu.c: Use HAVE_STRING_H, HAVE_STRINGS_H, HAVE_UNISTD_H,
	HAVE_TIME_H, HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H, HAVE_SYS_RESOURCE_H defined in
	the generated config.h.
	* debug.c: Ditto.
	* device_tree.c: Ditto.
	* devices.c: Ditto.
	* dgen.c: Ditto.
	* emul_netbsd.c: Ditto.
	* igen.c: Ditto.
	* lf.c: Ditto.
	* misc.c: Ditto.
	* psim.c: Ditto.
	* registers.c: Ditto.
	* sim_calls.c: Ditt.
	* table.c: Ditto.


	* main.c (main): Call psim_print_info with verbose == 2.

	* mon.c (mon_print_info): Align the cpu number and number of
	instructions fields.  Do not print an instruction category if the
	CPU did not execute any of those instructions.  Print out number
	of reads and writes.  If getrusage is supported, print out number
	of simulated instructins per second.
	
	* configure.in: Add support for --enable-sim-opcode=stupid.
	* configure: Regenerate.

Wed Nov  1 23:46:59 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* std-config (INLINE_DEVICE_TREE): Don't inline either of
        device_tree.c or devices.c.  There is no significant gain.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: add --enable-sim-icache=[0-9]* and
 	IGEN_ICACHE macro.
	
Wed Nov  1 23:46:59 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* igen.c (main), misc.h (target_a2i, i2target), misc.c: Add
        functions to convert between target and igen internal bit numbers.
        Make IO go through these functions. Add -b (bit size) and -h (high
        bit nr) options to igen.  Typical usage would be: ./igen -b 16 -h
        15 for a 16 bit instruction format with the msb given a number 15.

Wed Nov  1 22:17:32 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* dgen.c (main): Was outputting optarg even when it was NULL.

Tue Oct 31 23:48:33 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* vm_n.h (vm_data_map_load_N, vm_data_map_store_n), debug.h,
        debug.c: Add tracing of load/store unit (virtual) with -t
        load-store.

Tue Oct 31 21:44:01 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@highland.com.au>

        * std-config.h (WITH_ENVIRONMENT): Add USER_ENVIRONMENT which does
        not include things such as the time base and events.

	* interrupt.c, sim_calls.c, cpu.h, vm.c, configure.in: Add UEA to
 	all environment switches for above.

	* psim.c (psim_create): ditto - new device tree node name is
        /options/environment-architecture with values user, virtual and
        operating.

Tue Oct 31 21:31:32 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* ppc-opcode-stupid: Third example of use of opcode table - this
        one expands all mtspr/mfspr and branch instructions.  Appears to
        give about a 10% gain in performance if everything enabled.  Also
        takes about 150mb of swap to build.

Wed Nov  1 10:49:48 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* emul_netbsd.c (do_exit): Print arguments and close parenthesis
	if tracing, since exit doesn't go through emul_exit_call.
	(do_read): Print arguments if tracing.
	(do_write): Ditto.
	(do_open): Ditto.
	(do_break): Ditto.
	(do_kill): Ditto.

	(do_sigprocmask): Replace trace with printing arguments if
	tracing.
	(do_ioctl): Print arguments if tracing.
	(do_umask): Ditto.
	(do_dup2): Ditto.
	(do_fcntl): Ditto.
	(do_gettimeofday): Ditto.
	(do_getrusage): Ditto.
	(do_fstatfs): Ditto.

	* filter_filename.c: New file to provide filter_filename to strip
	the directory prefix from a file.
	* filter_filename.h: New include file to declare filter_filename.

	* debug.h: Include filter_filename.h.
	(TRACE,DTRACE,ERROR): Use filter_filename on __FILE__.

	* misc.h: Include filter_filename.h.
 	(ASSERT): Use filter_filename on __FILE__.

	* igen.c (lf_print_my_prefix): Use filter_filename on the filename
	argument.

	* Makefile.in: Add filter_filename support.

	* ppc-instructions (dcbi, icbi): Make these NOPs rather than
	invalid instructions.

	* configure.in: Add support for more --enable-sim-* switches.
	Use config.make and config.hdr to write to Makefile and config.h
	respectively.  Don't rewrite Makefile, just append to it.
	* configure: Regenerate.
	* config.{make,hdr}: New shell scripts.
	
	* Makefile.in: Remove all variables set by configure.in.
	(psim.o): Depend on $(BUILT_SRC) also.

	* emul_netbsd.c (do_gettimeofday,do_getrusage): When comparing an
	integer, use 0, not NULL.

Tue Oct 31 15:20:04 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Add support for --enable-sim-inline,
	--enable-sim-bswap, --enable-sim-cflags, --enable-sim-complex,
	--enable-sim-switch, --enable-sim-duplicate, --enable-sim-filter,
	and --enable-sim-endian switch to control various Makefile
	variables.
	* configure: Regenerate from configure.in.
	* Makefile.in: Add various Make variables that the various
	switches alter.

	* std-config.h (DEFAULT_INLINE): Don't set this to 2 if using GCC
	and optimizing by default.

Fri Oct 27 19:26:27 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* bits.h (ROTL32, ROTL64): Were functions, made them macros, now
 	make them functions again.  Appears 2.6.3 is confused by just a
 	macro.

Thu Oct 26 18:31:58 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* ppc-endian.c (SWAP_8): Fix 8 byte swap!

	* psim.c (psim_create): Not correctly checking that runtime
 	configuration of things like ENDIAN, ENVIRONMENT and ALIGNMENT
 	matched the compiled in ones.

	* debug.h (ITRACE), igen.c: Tidy up more tracing flags -
 	trace_semantics is now different to trace_idecode, the former
 	checks the cache.
	
Tue Oct 24 21:54:13 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* ppc-instructions (mtsrin): Missing instruction
	* ppc-instructions (mfsrin): Missing instruction
	* ppc-instructions (eieio): Missing instruction

Tue Oct 24 20:55:29 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* build-psim: New shell script - see internals for usage,
 	simplifies the process of building custom simulators.

Mon Oct 23 23:48:59 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* std-config.h (SEMANTICS_INLINE): Tidy up notes on each of the
        INLINE macros.  Make SEMANTICS_INLINE == 1 if DEFAULT_INLINE == 2.
        Don't use DEFAULT_INLINE to define REGISTERS_INLINE DEVICES_INLINE
        DEVICE_TREE_INLINE or INTERRUPTS_INLINE as none of these are on
        the instruction or data critical paths.
  	
	* FIXME: need to set up OS_EMUL_INLINE/EMUL_GENERIC_INLINE but
 	not on critical path.

	* FIXME: devices.c/emul_netbsd.c would benefit (slightly) from
 	the inclusion of device_tree.c/emul_generic.c.

Mon Oct 23 00:31:50 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* os_emul.[hc], emul_generic.[hc], emul_netbsd.[hc]: replace
        system.[hc].  Start of suport for multiple emulations and
        emulation state (os_emul object).

	* emul_generic.[hc]: Start of code to implement proper system call
	tracing (from spy).

Sun Oct 22 21:33:51 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* cpu.h, cpu.c (cpu_init): New function, zero the registers before
        the processor is started. Fixes problem of registers being
        undefined when restarting from within gdb.

	* cpu.h, cpu.c (cpu_flush_icache): New function, flushes the
        instruction cache (if present).  Fixes problem of cpu caching gdb
        breakpoint instructions.

	FIXME: PSIM sometimes aborts calling error(), it should instead
 	call sim_error() say which takes care of housekeeping such as
 	saving the CIA before calling error.
	
	* NOTE: cpu_flush_cache() instead of cpu_synchronize_context() is
 	used when restarting a simulation because the latter has the
 	unwanted side effect (well I as a kernel hacker think it is) of
 	performing an isync when the instruction stream doesn't contain
 	one.

Sun Oct 22 19:27:48 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* mon.h (new), mon.c (new), std-config.h (WITH_MON): Performance
        monitoring module. Counts both instructions issued and
        load/stores.

	* NOTE: mon does not contain to count instruction loads as this
 	information is already available from the mon_issue() hook.

	* FIXME: mon doesn't have access to register usage information.
  	This is needed if the user wants to monitor things like register
 	stalls.

	* igen.c (lf_print_c_semantic), vm_n.h: Add counting code.

	* psim.h, psim.c (psim_create), cpu.h, cpu.c (cpu_create): Attach
        a common monitor to each of the cpus. Delete
        cpu_increment_number_of_insns() and cpu_get_number_of_insns()
        replaced by copied code in mon.[hc].

Sun Oct 22 18:42:45 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* sim_calls.c, main.c, psim.c (psim_create): always create
        `WITH_SMP' cpus.  The actual number of CPU's active in a
        simulation run is taken from the device node: /init/smp (an
        integer). WITH_SMP changed to 2 (remember to put it back to 0).

Fri Oct 20 17:26:54 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* system.c: More system call emulation.  If code appears NetBSD
 	specific, make conditional to being compiled on a NetBSD system
 	(sigh).

Wed Oct 18 23:02:20 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>
	
	* Makefile.in, gen.c(delete), igen.c(new), dgen.c(new),
 	lf.[ch](new), table.[ch](new): Split into two generators - igen
 	that outputs the instruction tables and dgen that outputs the spr
 	tables.  Add -f (filter out) flag to igen to filter out certain
 	instructions (ex 64 bit ones) from the created tables.  Include
 	$(LIBIBERTY_LIB) in link options in case host lacks some libc
 	functions.

	* NOTE: igen, since it was originally written for the
 	PowerPC/RS6000, things the MSB is 0 and the LSB is 63{31}.
	
	* Makefile.in, std-config.h, ppc-cache-rules(new),
 	ppc-opcode-complex(new), ppc-opcode-simple(new): (for igen) Create
 	cache-rule and opcode-rule tables from macros found std-config.h.
 	Delete corresponding macro's from std-config.h.
  	
	* FIXME: under this new igen scheme, when playing around with igen
 	options, you'll find that depenencies don't work very well.

	* igen.c (gen_itable_c, gen_itable_h), Makefile.in: code to output
 	an table of all the instructions.  Code to output a type
 	enumerating all the instructin names.

	* igen.c(lf_print_c_semantic): Move call to increment instruction
 	counter so that it occures _after_ the instruction has been fully
 	validated, was double counting illegal/invalid instructions.  Add
 	conditional so only compiled in when WITH_PROFILE enabled (enabled
 	by default).
	
	* igen.c, cpu.h, cpu.c(cpu_increment_number_of_insns): Include
 	itable.h, count individual instruction types not just total,
 	adjust reporting functions to output this.
	
	* ppc-instructions (64 bit Load Doubleword with Update Indexed):
 	Had 32./ instead of 31./

	* ppc-instructions (64 bit Store Double Word Conditional Indexed):
 	bitrot - updated to use newer CR register operators.

	* ppc-instructions (64bit Floating Convert from Integer
 	Doubleword): Correct call to Round_Float().

Mon Oct 16 00:31:20 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* basics.h: #include "sim_callbacks.h" earlier so that its
 	prototypes are declared in all other header files.

	* bits.h, bits.c, idecode_expression.h (ROTL32, ROTL64): Update
 	doc in bits.h, remove dead code in bits.c, move ROTL32/ROTL64 into
 	bits.h.

	* FIXME: the bits.h/bits.c macro's should be replaced with
 	(inline) c functions.

	* cpu.c(cpu_add_commas), device_tree.h, device_tree.c(scand_*):
 	Add size of buffer argument to functions writing a string into a
 	buffer.  Check for buffer overflow.
	
Sun Oct 15 22:16:11 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* devices.h, devices.c, debug.h, debug.c: add macro's for tracing
        of each device.  Make parameter names consistent so macros work.
        Use macro's in device functions.

	* device_tree.c, devices.h, devices.c: include path to device in a
        devices node when creating it.

	* device_tree.c, debug.h, debug.c: Add tracing of `device-tree'.

	* core.c: add tracing of core-device, adjust parameter names in
 	core functions to be consistent with those in devices*.

Sun Oct 15 20:33:20 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

        * debug.h, debug.c (trace_option): New function. Parses the trace
        option, updating the trace array.

	* debug.h, debug.c (trace_usage): New function. Outputs the list
        of all possible trace options.

	* sim_calls.c (sim_open), main.c (main): Use new trace_option() to
 	parse trace options specified with the simpler -t flag.  Adjust
 	usage.

	* FIXME: basic parsing of command line options is still duplicated
 	by main.c and sim_calls.c

Thu Oct 26 10:42:28 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (clean): Delete *.i and *.out files.

	* ppc-endian.c (SWAP_n): Add SET argument to allow use of SWAP
	macros for either assignment or return.  Fix SWAP_8 to use a
	union, and two SWAP_4's.  Delete SWAP_N, since nobody uses it now.
	(ENDIAN_N): Add SET argument to SWAP_n calls.  Delete macro defs
	that hardwired swapping on/off, let optimizer delete dead code.

	* main.c (main): Add printf that we caught a signal and print out
	the failing address.

Thu Oct 19 21:43:39 1995  Fred Fish  <fnf@fishfood.amigalib.com>

	* Makefile.in:  Remove tabs from otherwise empty line.
	Confuses many non-GNU versions of "make".

Wed Oct 18 08:51:25 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (clean): Delete files produced by gen.

Mon Oct 16 17:34:24 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* gen.c (lf_print_c_semantic_function): Move counting # of
	instructions here so it works with caching.
	(gen_idecode_c): Move from here.

Wed Oct 11 17:13:15 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* gen.c, ppc-instructions, psim.c: Fix code for generating
	cracking instruction cache.  Delete the code that cached just the
	result from doing an instruction lookup - this ran slower than no
	cache at all.

Fri Oct 13 09:58:43 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (gen.o): Include $(INLINE_CFLAGS).

	* debug.h (ppc_trace): Rename from trace, to avoid a conflict with
	TCL when gdb is linked with the simulator.
	* debug.c (ppc_trace): Ditto.
	* sim_calls.c (sim_open): Change trace -> ppc_trace.
	* main.c (main): Ditto.

	* cpu.c (cpu_add_commas): Remove extra static.

Thu Oct 12 11:35:53 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (psim.o): Now that inlines are turned on, make
	psim.o depend on all sources.

	* cpu.c (cpu_add_commas): New function to format a long with
	commas.
	(cpu_print_info): Use it to print number_of_insns.
	
	* ppc-endian.c (SWAP_n): New macros to speed up byte swapping for
	2, 4, and 8 bytes.
	(ENDIAN_N): If both target and host byte orders are known, don't
	bother testing CURRENT_{TARGET,HOST}_BYTE_ORDER.

	* ppc-endian.h (target specific H2T_n/T2H_n macros): Remove #if 0
	to allow target specific H2T_n/T2H_n macros to be used.
	(htonl, ntohl): If compiled on a 486 by GCC and WITH_BSWAP is
	non-zero, redefine the htonl/ntohl macros to use the BSWAP instead
	of the 3 instruction sequence that runs on 386s.

	* std-config.h (WITH_{HOST,TARGET}_BYTE_ORDER): Don't override if
	specified on the compile line.
	(WITH_BSWAP): If not defined, define as 0.

	* Makefile.in (INLINE_CFLAGS): Add -DDEFAULT_INLINE=2 to add
	default inline support.  Pass INLINE_CFLAGS when compiling.

	* devices.{h,c} (unimp_device_ioctl): Use STATIC_DEVICES, not
	INLINE_DEVICES since GCC doesn't like inline functions that
	accept variable arguments.
	(stack_ioctl_callback): Make function just static because GCC
	doesn't like inline functions that accept variable arguments.

	* devices.h (STATIC_DEVICES): Define as empty if not defined.

	* inline.c: Correct pathnames of included C files to match current
	implementation.

	* inline.h (STATIC_DEVICES): If DEVICES_INLINE is defined to be
	non-zero, define STATIC_DEVICES to be static.

	* std-config.h (INLINE): If GNU C and optimizing, define this as
	__inline__.
	(DEFAULT_INLINE): If not defined, define as 0.
	(ENDIAN_INLINE): If not defined, define as DEFAULT_INLINE.
	({CORE,VM,CPU,EVENTS,REGISTERS,INTERRUPTS}_INLINE): Ditto.
	({SPREG,IDECODE}_INLINE): Ditto.	
	
Wed Oct 11 17:13:15 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

        * ppc-instructions: Initial cut of floating point suport added.
  	Of note include - use of host IEEE floating point instructions,
 	use of PowerPC manual pseudo code to handle the FPSCR.  It is not
 	currently a pretty sight.
	
	* memory_map.h, memory_map.c, memory_map_n.h, core.h, core.c:
 	merge into core.h, core.c, core_n.h. The type memory_map replaced
 	with core_map.  This removes a level of pointer indirection when
 	translating an address.

	* memory_map.h, memory_map.c, memory_map_n.h: delete.

	* Makefile.in et.al (sorry): tweek to use new core, core_map and
 	core.h.
	
Wed Oct 11 12:10:26 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* sim_calls.c, main.c: Add -g (trace_gdb) option, add tracing to
 	most of the other functions in sim_calls.c.

	* basics.h (CONCAT3), memory_map.c, memory_map_n.h, Makefile.in:
 	Add macros to better cover up `generic' code.  Makes it possible
 	to step through the generic code!

	* vm.c, vm_n.h, Makefile.in: ditto
	
Tue Oct 10 15:42:59 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* devices.h, devices.c, memory_map.h, memory_map.c: Changed
 	callback interface so that there is a read/write buffer but no
 	read/write_word.  VEA default memory read/write handler sometimes
 	couldn't resolve an access and of those some were for a memory
 	fault and some were because gdb was making a bogus request.

	* devices.h, devices.c, memory_map.h, memory_map.c, vm.h, vm.c:
 	eliminate transfer_mode (raw or cooked) parameter from read/write
 	buffer.
	
Fri Oct  6 20:23:56 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* ppc-instructions (fmul, fmuls): correct instruction format - had
 	FRB instead of FRC.

Wed Oct  4 17:31:12 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* psim.c, device_tree.h, device_tree.c, devices.c (printd_*,
 	scand_*): new functions to parse/print fields in device names
 	while hiding any machine dependency.

	* devices.c, psim.c: Change the stack init code so that it is
 	handled by a device.  Arguments passed across using a device ioctl
 	(hack).

	* devices.h, devices.c: device ioctl callback changed to allow a
 	variable number of arguments.  This gives greater flexability and
 	greater chance of bugs.

Tue Oct  3 22:01:56 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* main.c (printf_filtered, error): Missing va_end() to close off
        variable argument use.

	* Makefile.in (tmp-gencode): comment out hack to get around some
        versions of make not handling files being created as side-effects.

	* gen.c (lf_open): Add -n (real_file_name) option.  Specifies an
        alternative file name to use in output files for things like #line
        macros.

        Makefile.in (tmp-gencode): Use gen -n so that debug info is
        correct.

	* Makefile.in (TARGETLIB): Use this instead of libsim.a in the
	Makefile.

Sat Oct  7 22:40:59 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* sim_calls.c (sim_set_callbacks): Define new function.

Fri Oct  6 17:23:10 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* psim.c (psim_print_info): Print exit status or signal number.

Mon Oct  2 11:46:37 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	instructions are executed.
	(cpu_increment_number_of_insns): New function to increment the
	number of instructions issued.
	(cpu_get_number_of_insns): New function to return the number of
	instructions issued.
	(cpu_print_info): New function to print cpu related information.
	At present, print the number of instructions executed.

	* gen_idecode_c: Emit call to cpu_increment_number_of_insns within
	idecode_issue.

	* psim.c (psim_print_info): New function to iterate over each of
	the CPU's calling cpu_print_info.
	
	* psim.h,cpu.h: Add new declarations.

	* sim_calls.c (sim_open): Add argument processing to add the same
	switches main.c accepts for the standalone processor.
	(sim_close): Call psim_print_info if -I.

	* main.c (main): Add comment saying to update sim_calls.c when
	adding switches.  Add -I to call psim_print_info when done.
	(usage): Update usage message.

Sun Oct  1 13:52:59 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* main.c (printf_filtered): Correct to match new prototype.

Sat Sep 30 20:47:05 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	0x100000.
	(clayton_memory_size): Define as OEA_MEMORY_SIZE.

	* std-config.h (WITH_TRACE): Default to 1 now.

	* psim.c (write_stack_arguments): Don't write any stack arguments

	on console tracing.

	* device_tree.c (create_option_device_node): Assume a program is
	OEA if the start address is < 4096, not just == 0.

	* Makefile.in (install): Don't install in $(tooldir).

	* configure.in: Call AC_CONFIG_HEADER.  Don't try to use
	bfd/hosts/*.h file or bfd/config/*.mh file.  Call AC_PROG_CC and
	AC_PROG_RANLIB.  Substitute in values for CFLAGS, HDEFINES, AR,
	and CC_FOR_BUILD.  Call AC_CHECK_HEADERS for various header files.

Fri Sep  8 09:51:03 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* configure{,.in}: Don't include sysdep.h from bfd, since bfd no
	longer provides it.
	* basics.h (sysdep.h): Don't include it.
	* Makefile.in (BASICS_H): Remove sysdep.h.

Wed Sep  6 13:25:42 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>
 
 	* core.c (core_add_data): First growth of bss was being put at
        wrong address (0) instead of &end.
 
 	* core.c (core_add_stack, core_add_data): Was not handling case
        where bss/stack is grown across the current end-of-{bss,stack}.

Wed Sep  6 00:46:10 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* system.c (system_call): Fix SYS_break - was aligning bss to a
        page boundary instead of just an 8 byte one; On first call sbrk(0)
        != sbrk(0).

Thu Aug 24 14:48:54 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): Fix install rule.

Tue Aug 22 09:31:18 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* system.c (system_call): Add read support.

	* main.c (main): -t sets trace_device_tree.  Correct usage message
	to current reality.

	* device_tree.c (update_memory_node_for_section): Make tracing
	output line up.  If not code or readonly, assume that the section
	is a data section and has read/write permissions.  Add readonly
	support.

	* core.c (create_core_from_addresses): Print end address in traces
	and make tracing output line up.

	* Makefile.in: Rewrite from Makefile to work with the Cygnus
	environment, and support compiling in a different directory than
	the sources reside in.

	* ppc-endian.h: Rename from endian.h so that it doesn't get
	confused with /usr/include/sys/endian.h on Linux.  Add Linux
	endian support.

	* ppc-endian.c: Rename to be consistant with ppc-endian.h.
	Include ppc-endian.h, not endian.h.

	* basics.h (sysdep.h): Include sysdep.h that configure makes.
	Include ppc-endian.h, not endian.h.

	* std-config.h: Rename from ppc-config.  Put #ifndefs around most
	configuration macros, so they can be overridden via CFLAGS.  By
	default, turn off tracing.

	* configure.in: Clone from other simulator targets.
	* configure: Generate via autoconf from configure.in.

Sat Aug 19 09:05:32 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* ppc-instructions: fix srawi (was geting XER[CA] real wrong).

	* interrupts.c (data_storage_interrupt): allow stack to grow by
        upto one MB per increment.

	* ppc-instructions: divw was computing rA / rA not rA / rB

	* main.c (main): really stupid. Wasn't exiting with correct status

Fri Aug 18 00:38:01 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* system.c (system_call): add system calls kill(2) and getpid(2).

	* main.c (main): Check/return exit status when simulation
        finishes.

Thu Aug 17 14:29:18 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* device_tree.c (create_option_device_node): Alignment rules (at
 	least for the moment) now are for strict alignment only for LE OEA
 	mode.  (Because of compiler problems).

	* system.c (system_call) SYS_exit: Wasn't exiting with correct status.

Thu Aug 17 01:16:38 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@highland.com.au>

	* vm.c (DEFINE_VM_DATA_MAP_WRITE_N): For miss aligned transfer
        forgot to return.

	* system.c (system_call): didn't page align break argument before
        determining increment break increment.

	* psim/ppc: Re-arange entire directory structure so that
        everything lives in the one directory.  While a pain for cleaning,
        makes building across multiple architectures much simpler.

	* devices.c, device_tree.c: Added code that provides a simple
        illustration of how an interrupt control device could be
        implemented.

	* devices.c: Added code so that the dumb console device can read
        (from stdin) as well as write to stdout.
