Fri Sep  8 09:51:03 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* configure{,.in}: Don't include sysdep.h from bfd, since bfd no
	longer provides it.
	* basics.h (sysdep.h): Don't include it.
	* Makefile.in (BASICS_H): Remove sysdep.h.

Wed Sep  6 13:25:42 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@kremvax>
 
 	* core.c (core_add_data): First growth of bss was being put at
        wrong address (0) instead of &end.
 
 	* core.c (core_add_stack, core_add_data): Was not handling case
        where bss/stack is grown across the current end-of-{bss,stack}.

Wed Sep  6 00:46:10 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@kremvax>

	* system.c (system_call): Fix SYS_break - was aligning bss to a
        page boundary instead of just an 8 byte one; On first call sbrk(0)
        != sbrk(0).

Thu Aug 24 14:48:54 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.in (install): Fix install rule.

Tue Aug 22 09:31:18 1995  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* system.c (system_call): Add read support.

	* main.c (main): -t sets trace_device_tree.  Correct usage message
	to current reality.

	* device_tree.c (update_memory_node_for_section): Make tracing
	output line up.  If not code or readonly, assume that the section
	is a data section and has read/write permissions.  Add readonly
	support.

	* core.c (create_core_from_addresses): Print end address in traces
	and make tracing output line up.

	* Makefile.in: Rewrite from Makefile to work with the Cygnus
	environment, and support compiling in a different directory than
	the sources reside in.

	* ppc-endian.h: Rename from endian.h so that it doesn't get
	confused with /usr/include/sys/endian.h on Linux.  Add Linux
	endian support.

	* ppc-endian.c: Rename to be consistant with ppc-endian.h.
	Include ppc-endian.h, not endian.h.

	* basics.h (sysdep.h): Include sysdep.h that configure makes.
	Include ppc-endian.h, not endian.h.

	* std-config.h: Rename from ppc-config.  Put #ifndefs around most
	configuration macros, so they can be overridden via CFLAGS.  By
	default, turn off tracing.

	* configure.in: Clone from other simulator targets.
	* configure: Generate via autoconf from configure.in.

Sat Aug 19 09:05:32 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@kremvax>

	* ppc-instructions: fix srawi (was geting XER[CA] real wrong).

	* interrupts.c (data_storage_interrupt): allow stack to grow by
        upto one MB per increment.

	* ppc-instructions: divw was computing rA / rA not rA / rB

	* main.c (main): really stupid. Wasn't exiting with correct status

Fri Aug 18 00:38:01 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@kremvax>

	* system.c (system_call): add system calls kill(2) and getpid(2).

	* main.c (main): Check/return exit status when simulation
        finishes.

Thu Aug 17 14:29:18 1995  Andrew Cagney  <cagney@kremvax>

	* device_tree.c (create_option_device_node): Alignment rules (at
 	least for the moment) now are for strict alignment only for LE OEA
 	mode.  (Because of compiler problems).

	* system.c (system_call) SYS_exit: Wasn't exiting with correct status.

Thu Aug 17 01:16:38 1995  Andrew Cagney - aka Noid  <cagney@kremvax>

	* vm.c (DEFINE_VM_DATA_MAP_WRITE_N): For miss aligned transfer
        forgot to return.

	* system.c (system_call): didn't page align break argument before
        determining increment break increment.

	* psim/ppc: Re-arange entire directory structure so that
        everything lives in the one directory.  While a pain for cleaning,
        makes building across multiple architectures much simpler.

	* devices.c, device_tree.c: Added code that provides a simple
        illustration of how an interrupt control device could be
        implemented.

	* devices.c: Added code so that the dumb console device can read
        (from stdin) as well as write to stdout.
