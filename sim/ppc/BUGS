ChangeLog

See the ChangeLog file looking for lines taged with the word FIXME.

COREFILE.C:

The implementation of corefile.c (defined by corefile.h) isn't the
best.  It is intended to be functionaly correct rather than fast.  One
option being considered is to add a data cache to reduce the overhead
of the most common case of data read/writes.

VEA

Missing VEA system calls.

ppc-instructions:

Missing or commented out instructions.

64bit:

64bit target untested. 64bit host broken.  For instance use of scanf
"%x", &long long.

events.c:

Event code for pending events from within signal handlers not
finished/tested.

hw_*.c:

Better and more devices.

PORTABILITY:

(Notes taken from Michael Meissner): Heavy use of the ## operator -
fix using the clasic X/**/Y hack; Use of the signed keyword.  In
particular, signed char has no analogue in classic C (though most
implementations of classic C use signed chars); Use of long long which
restricts the target compiler to be GCC.


device_ioctl():

Should have an extra argument (unsigned request) as standard.
