	* aclocal.m4:  Remove Make-common.in from dependencies.
	* (distclean):  Remove targ-vals.def.

	* aclocal.m4 (SIM_AC_COMMON):  Move contents of Make-common.in
	into here.  Makes insertion into makefiles easier.  Also, change
	the way that callback.o, gentmap, targ-vals.h, targ-map.c,
	targ-map.o, and run are built.  They are now built in the
	individual simulator directories, taking sources from ../common as
	necessary.  This replaces the merging of libcommon.a into
	linsim.a, which was problematic for the WinGDB build process.
	* run.c:  Include config.h from . instead of ../common.
	* Make-common.in:  Remove.  It's no longer necessary.

Mon Dec 16 15:02:33 1996  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* Make-common.in (ALL_CLAGS): Put CFLAGS at the end.
	(.c.o): Put $(ALL_CFLAGS) before the file being compiled.

Wed Dec 11 11:30:58 1996  Jim Wilson  <wilson@cygnus.com>

	* run.c (main): Set target_byte_order before call to sim_open.

Sun Dec  8 18:22:06 1996  Doug Evans  <dje@canuck.cygnus.com>

	* callback.c: #include <stdlib.h>
	(os_error): New function.
	(default_callback): Add os_error.

Mon Nov 25 19:44:35 1996  Doug Evans  <dje@canuck.cygnus.com>

	* Make-common.in (Makefile): Set CONFIG_HEADERS="".
	* aclocal.m4: Mark the fact that --enable-sim-bswap isn't host
	specific.
	(SIM_AC_OUTPUT): Don't build Makefile if CONFIG_FILES="".

Wed Nov 20 01:11:04 1996  Doug Evans  <dje@canuck.cygnus.com>

	* run.c: #include ../common/config.h, tconfig.h.
	(myname): New static global.
	(main): Recognize new options -a, -c.  Also recognize -h if h8/300.
	Only process -c ifdef SIM_HAVE_SIMCACHE.
	Only process -p/-s ifdef SIM_HAVE_PROFILE.
	Parse program name from argv[0] and use in error messages.
	Pass sim_args to sim_open.  Pass prog_args to sim_create_inferior.
	Add support for incomplete h8/300 termination indicators.
	(usage): Make more verbose.
	* aclocal.m4,config.in,tconfig.in,configure.in,configure: New files.
	* Makefile.in,Make-common.in,callback.c: New files.
	* nltvals.def,gentmap.c,gentvals.sh: New files.

	* run.c (main): Don't print out anything if the signal
	number is zero (ie no signal).

Tue Oct 15 11:20:44 1996  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* run.c (main): Print out if the program raised a signal.

Wed Sep 18 09:52:14 1996  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* run.c (exec_bfd): Rename from sim_bfd, to use the gdb name.
	(main): Ditto.

Tue Sep 17 11:04:50 1996  James G. Smith  <jsmith@cygnus.co.uk>

	* run.c (main): Explicitly cast malloc() parameter.

Thu Sep 12 11:27:21 1996  Michael Meissner  <meissner@tiktok.cygnus.com>

	* run.c (sim_bfd): New global to hold the bfd pointer for the
	executable.

Wed Nov  8 15:49:49 1995  James G. Smith  <jsmith@pasanda.cygnus.co.uk>

	* run.c (main): Removed SH specific comments, so source is
 	generic. Also updated to only load relevant sections. Moved
 	sim_open() to after callback attach (to match GDB).

  	* run.1: Removed SH specific comments.

Sat Oct 21 12:31:01 1995  Jim Wilson  <wilson@chestnut.cygnus.com>

	bfd_check_format() fails.

	* run.c, run.1: From sh directory.
