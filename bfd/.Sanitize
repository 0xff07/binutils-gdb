# Each directory to survive it's way into a release will need a file
# like this one called "./.Sanitize".  All keyword lines must exist,
# and must exist in the order specified by this file.  Each directory
# in the tree will be processed, top down, in the following order.

# Hash started lines like this one are comments and will be deleted
# before anything else is done.  Blank lines will also be squashed
# out.

# The lines between the "Do-first:" line and the "Things-to-keep:"
# line are executed as a /bin/sh shell script before anything else is
# done in this 

Do-first:

# All files listed between the "Things-to-keep:" line and the
# "Files-to-sed:" line will be kept.  All other files will be removed.
# Directories listed in this section will have their own Sanitize
# called.  Directories not listed will be removed in their entirety
# with rm -rf.

# $Log$
# Revision 1.35  1992/01/24 22:42:49  sac
# Uses the new small reloc type now.
#
# Currently self hosts on sun4 and sun3
#
# Revision 1.34  1991/12/18  23:01:48  bothner
# Use aout-target.h more extensively.
# Replace Berkeley functions (e.g. bcopy) with ANSI ones (e.g. memcpy).
# Other improvements (see ChangeLog).
#
# Revision 1.33  1991/12/12  03:19:36  sac
# Added configdos.bat makefile.dos
#
# Revision 1.32  1991/11/27  16:58:22  sac
# Added h8
#
# Revision 1.31  1991/11/22  05:00:08  bothner
# 	Moved bfd_stab_name() and bfd_stab_names[]
# 	from syms.c to new file stab-syms.c.
# 	Renamed to  aout_stab_name() and aout_stab_names[].
# 	Also, since GNU extended type codes such as N_SETT are no longer
# 	in ../include/stab.def, include them manually.
#
# Revision 1.30  1991/11/21  01:56:17  gnu
# Avoid duplicate echo.
#
# Revision 1.29  1991/11/17  21:38:05  bothner
# 	* targets.c:  Make the default target_vector contain
# 	just &DEFAULT_VECTOR.  This makes executables a lot smaller.
# 	Old behavior can be gotten by defining ALL_TARGETS.
# 	* aoutf1.h, demo64.c, i386aout.c, newsos3.c, sunos.c:
# 	Factored out common code into new file aout-target.h.
# 	Saves a lot of duplicate code for a.out variants.
#
# Revision 1.28  1991/11/04  00:37:06  steve
# Added ctor.c (I remembered this time)
#
# Revision 1.27  1991/10/25  10:17:41  gnu
# * Rename COFF-related files in `coff-ARCH.c' form.
# coff-a29k.c, coff-i386.c, coff-i960.c, coff-m68k.c, coff-m88k.c,
# coff-mips.c, coff-rs6000.c to be exact.
#
# Revision 1.26  1991/10/25  07:16:59  gnu
# RS/6000 support
#
# Revision 1.25  1991/10/15  07:29:13  bothner
# Add hosts directory.
#
# Revision 1.24  1991/10/08  22:31:51  gnu
# Add i386aout.c
#
# Revision 1.23  1991/10/05  06:16:44  gnu
# howto.c, configure, config.sub gone.
#
# Revision 1.22  1991/10/03  22:23:56  gnu
# Add elf.c
#
# Revision 1.21  1991/10/01  03:55:34  steve
# Insert the incidentals and things I forgot to ci last time, same log message:
#
# Mon Sep 30 15:13:46 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)
#
# 	* cpu-a29k.c, cpu-i386.c, cpu-m68k.c, cpu-mips.c, cpu-vax.c,
# 	cpu-h8300.c, cpu-i960.c, cpu-m88k.c, cpu-sparc.c: added. These
# 	files will eventually contain processor specific bits for bfd,
# 	like strange relocation information and dis/assembly.  So far only
# 	the H8 has been even partially done.  This work also ties in with
# 	the change in handling architectures.
#
# 	* amdcoff.c: (a29k_reloc) fix error message.
#
# 	* aout-f1.h: (choose_reloc_size) now calls bfd_get_arch to
# 	discover the architecture of the bfd. (sunos4_callback) calls the
# 	function bfd_set_arch_mach rather than stuffing stuff directly
# 	into the bfd. (sunos4_write_object_contents), changed names of
# 	accessor functions.
#
# 	* aoutx.h: (set_arch_mach) now calls bfd_default_set_arch_mach to
# 	setup the environment.
#
# 	* archive.c: (bfd_slurp_coff_armap) coff archives always have the
# 	headers in big endian format, regardless of the endianess of the
# 	host or target.
#
# 	* archures.c: totally changed. Now an architecture is represented
# 	with a pointer to an info structure rather than an enumerated type
# 	and a long. The old info is available as two elements in the
# 	structure.  Future enhancements to architecure support will
# 	involve pointers to methods being placed into the info structure.
#
# 	* bfd.c: changed the definition of the bfd structure for the new
# 	architecture stuff.
#
# 	* bout.c: (b_out_set_arch_mach) changed to use the new
# 	architecture mechanism.
#
# 	* coffcode.h: (coff_set_arch_mach, coff_set_flags) changed to use
# 	the new architecture mechanism.
#
# 	* configure.in: added h8 stuff.
#
# 	* ieee.c: too many changes to note.  Now ieee files written with
# 	bfd gas and ld can be read by gld and ieee only linkers and
# 	simulators.
#
# 	* libbfd.c, libbfd.h: changed prototype of bfd_write.
#
# 	* newsos3.c: (newos3_callback) now calls bfd_set_arch_mach rather
# 	than fixing the structure directly.
#
# 	* oasys.c: (oasys_object_p) now calls bfd_default_set_arch_mach rather
# 	than fixing the structure directly.
#
# 	* opncls.c: (new_bfd) makes sure that bfd_init has been called
# 	before opening a bfd.
#
# 	* srec.c: (srec_set_arch_mach) now calls bfd_default_set_arch_mach
# 	rather than fixing the structure directly.
#
# 	* targets.c: (target_vector) now by defining SELECT_VECS (perhaps
# 	in the t/hmake file) a user can select which backends they want
# 	linked with bfd without changing the source.
#
# 	* init.c: new, looks after initializing modules.
#
# 	* howto.c: for future use, will allow an application to work out
# 	what cookie to use as a handle on a relcoatio howto.
