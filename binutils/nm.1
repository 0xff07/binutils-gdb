.SH DESCRIPTION
GNU \c
.B nm\c
\& will list the symbols from object files \c
.I objfiles\c
\&.

.SH OPTIONS
The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.

.TP
.IR "objfiles" .\|.\|.
Object files whose symbols are to be listed.  If no object files are
listed as arguments, \c
.B nm\c
\& assumes `\|\c
.B a.out\c
\|'.

.TP
.B \-a
.TP
.B +debug-syms 
Display debugger-only symbols; normally these are not listed.

.TP
.B \-g
.TP
.B +extern-only 
Display only external symbols.

.TP
.B \-p
.TP
.B +no-sort 
Don't bother to sort the symbols in any order; just print them in the
order encountered.

.TP
.B \-n
.TP
.B +numeric-sort 
Sort symbols numerically by their addresses, not alphabetically by their
names. 

.TP
.B \-s
.TP
.B +print-armap
When listing symbols from archive members, include the index: a mapping
(stored in the archive by \c
.B ar\c
\& or \c
.B ranlib\c
\&) of what modules
contain definitions for what names.

.TP
.B \-o
.TP
.B +print-file-name 
Precede each symbol by the name of the input file where it was found,
rather than identifying the input file once only before all of its
symbols. 

.TP
.B \-r
.TP
.B +reverse-sort 
Reverse the sense of the sort (whether numeric or alphabetic); let the
last come first.

.TP
.BI "+target " "bfdname"\c
\&
Specify an object code format other than your system's default format.
See 
.BR objdump ( 1 ),
for information on listing available formats.

.TP
.B \-u
.TP
.B +undefined-only 
Display only undefined symbols (those external to each object file).
