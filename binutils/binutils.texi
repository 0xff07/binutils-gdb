@end smallexample

The GNU @code{ar} program creates, modifies, and extracts from
archives.  An @dfn{archive} is a single file holding a collection of
other files in a structure that makes it possible to retrieve
the original individual files (called @dfn{members} of the archive).

The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and
group are preserved in the archive, and may be reconstituted on
extraction.  

@cindex name length
GNU @code{ar} can maintain archives whose members have names of any
length; however, depending on how @code{ar} is configured on your
system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed (for compatibility
with archive formats maintained with other tools).  If it exists, the
limit is often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16
characters (typical of formats related to coff).

@cindex libraries
@code{ar} is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort
are most often used as @dfn{libraries} holding commonly needed
subroutines.

@cindex symbol index
@code{ar} will create an index to the symbols defined in relocatable
object modules in the archive when you specify the modifier @samp{s}.
Once created, this index is updated in the archive whenever @code{ar}
makes a change to its contents (save for the @samp{q} update operation).
An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.

You may use @samp{nm -s} or @samp{nm +print-armap} to list this index
table.  If an archive lacks the table, another form of @code{ar} called
@code{ranlib} can be used to add just the table.

@cindex compatibility, @code{ar}
@cindex @code{ar} compatibility
GNU @code{ar} is designed to be compatible with two different
facilities.  You can control its activity using command-line options,
like the different varieties of @code{ar} on Unix systems; or, if you
specify the single command-line option @samp{-M}, you can control it
with a script supplied via standard input, like the MRI ``librarian''
program.

@section Controlling @code{ar} on the command line

@smallexample
  ar [-]@var{p}@var{mod} [ @var{membername} ] @var{archive} @var{files}@dots{}
@end smallexample

@cindex Unix compatibility, @code{ar}
When you use @code{ar} in the Unix style, @code{ar} insists on at least two
arguments to execute: one keyletter specifying the @emph{operation}
(optionally accompanied by other keyletters specifying
@emph{modifiers}), and the archive name to act on.

Most operations can also accept further @var{files} arguments,
specifying particular files to operate on.

GNU @code{ar} allows you to mix the operation code @var{p} and modifier
flags @var{mod} in any order, within the first command-line argument.

If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
dash.

@cindex operations on archive
The @var{p} keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may be
any of the following, but you must specify only one of them:

@table @code
@item d
@cindex deleting from archive
@emph{Delete} modules from the archive.  Specify the names of modules to
be deleted as @var{files}; the archive is untouched if you
specify no files to delete.

If you specify the @samp{v} modifier, @code{ar} will list each module
as it is deleted.

@item m
@cindex moving in archive
Use this operation to @emph{move} members in an archive.

The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in how
programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in more
than one member.  

If no modifiers are used with @code{m}, any members you name in the
@var{files} arguments are moved to the @emph{end} of the archive;
you can use the @samp{a}, @samp{b}, or @samp{i} modifiers to move them to a
specified place instead.

@item p
@cindex printing from archive
@emph{Print} the specified members of the archive, to the standard
output file.  If the @samp{v} modifier is specified, show the member
name before copying its contents to standard output.

If you specify no @var{files}, all the files in the archive are printed.

@item q
@cindex quick append to archive
@emph{Quick append}; add @var{files} to the end of @var{archive},
without checking for replacement.  

The modifiers @samp{a}, @samp{b}, and @samp{i} do @emph{not} affect this
operation; new members are always placed at the end of the archive.

The modifier @samp{v} makes @code{ar} list each file as it is appended.

Since the point of this operation is speed, the archive's symbol table
index is not updated, even if it already existed; you can use @samp{ar s} or
@code{ranlib} explicitly to update the symbol table index.

@item r
@cindex replacement in archive
Insert @var{files} into @var{archive} (with @emph{replacement}). This
operation differs from @samp{q} in that any previously existing members
are deleted if their names match those being added.

If one of the files named in @var{files} doesn't exist, @code{ar}
displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing members
of the archive matching that name.

By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but you may
use one of the modifiers @samp{a}, @samp{b}, or @samp{i} to request
placement relative to some existing member.

The modifier @samp{v} used with this operation elicits a line of
output for each file inserted, along with one of the letters @samp{a} or
@samp{r} to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member
deleted) or replaced.

@item t
@cindex contents of archive
Display a @emph{table} listing the contents of @var{archive}, or those
of the files listed in @var{files} that are present in the
archive.  Normally only the member name is shown; if you also want to
see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group, and size, you can
request that by also specifying the @samp{v} modifier.

If you do not specify any @var{files}, all files in the archive
are listed.

@cindex repeated names in archive
@cindex name duplication in archive
If there is more than one file with the same name (say, @samp{fie}) in
an archive (say @samp{b.a}), @samp{ar t b.a fie} will list only the
first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
listing---in our example, @samp{ar t b.a}.
@c WRS only; per Gumby, this is implementation-dependent, and in a more
@c recent case in fact works the other way.

@item x
@cindex extract from archive
@emph{Extract} members (named @var{files}) from the archive.  You can
use the @samp{v} modifier with this operation, to request that
@code{ar} list each name as it extracts it.

If you do not specify any @var{files}, all files in the archive
are extracted.

@end table

A number of modifiers (@var{mod}) may immediately follow the @var{p}
keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior:

@table @code
@item a
@cindex relative placement in archive
Add new files @emph{after} an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier @code{a}, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the @var{membername} argument, before the
@var{archive} specification.

@item b
Add new files @emph{before} an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier @code{b}, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the @var{membername} argument, before the
@var{archive} specification.  (same as @samp{i}).

@item c
@cindex creating archives
@emph{Create} the archive.  The specified @var{archive} is always
created if it didn't exist, when you request an update.  But a warning is
issued unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by
using this modifier.

@item i
Insert new files @emph{before} an existing member of the
archive.  If you use the modifier @code{i}, the name of an existing archive
member must be present as the @var{membername} argument, before the
@var{archive} specification.  (same as @samp{b}).

@item l
This modifier is accepted but not used.
@c whaffor ar l modifier??? presumably compat; with
@c what???---pesch@@cygnus.com, 25jan91 

@item o
@cindex dates in archive
Preserve the @emph{original} dates of members when extracting them.  If
you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive
will be stamped with the time of extraction.

@item s
@cindex writing archive index
Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one,
even if no other change is made to the archive.  You may use this modifier
flag either with any operation, or alone.  Running @samp{ar s} on an
archive is equivalent to running @samp{ranlib} on it.

@item u
@cindex updating an archive
Normally, @code{ar r}@dots{} inserts all files
listed into the archive.  If you would like to insert @emph{only} those
of the files you list that are newer than existing members of the same
names, use this modifier.  The @samp{u} modifier is allowed only for the
operation @samp{r} (replace).  In particular, the combination @samp{qu} is
not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any speed
advantage from the operation @samp{q}.

@item v
This modifier requests the @emph{verbose} version of an operation.  Many
operations display additional information, such as filenames processed,
when the modifier @samp{v} is appended.

@section Controlling @code{ar} with a script

@smallexample
ar -M [ <@var{script} ]
@end smallexample

@cindex MRI compatibility, @code{ar}
@cindex scripts, @code{ar}
If you use the single command-line option @samp{-M} with @code{ar}, you
can control its operation with a rudimentary command language.  This
form of @code{ar} will operate interactively if standard input is coming
directly from a terminal.  During interactive use, @code{ar} prompts for
input (the prompt is @samp{AR >}), and continues executing even after
errors.  If you redirect standard input to a script file, no prompts are
issued, and @code{ar} will abandon execution (with a nonzero exit code)
on any error.

The @code{ar} command language is @emph{not} designed to be equivalent
to the command-line options; in fact, it provides somewhat less control
over archives.  The only purpose of the command language is to ease the
transition to GNU @code{ar} for developers who already have scripts
written for the MRI ``librarian'' program.

The syntax for the @code{ar} command language is straightforward:
@itemize @bullet
@item
commands are recognized in upper or lower case; for example, @code{LIST}
is the same as @code{list}.  In the following descriptions, commands are
shown in upper case for clarity.

@item
a single command may appear on each line; it is the first word on the
line.

@item
empty lines are allowed, and have no effect.

@item
comments are allowed; text after either of the characters @samp{*}
or @samp{;} is ignored.

@item
Whenever you use a list of names as part of the argument to an @code{ar}
command, you can separate the individual names with either commas or
blanks.  Commas are shown in the explanations below, for clarity.

@item
@samp{+} is used as a line continuation character; if @samp{+} appears
at the end of a line, the text on the following line is considered part
of the current command.
@end itemize

Here are the commands you can use in @code{ar} scripts, or when using
@code{ar} interactively.  Three of them have special significance:

@code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE} specify a @dfn{current archive}, which is
a temporary file required for most of the other commands.

@code{SAVE} commits the changes so far specified by the script.  Prior
to @code{SAVE}, commands affect only the temporary copy of the current
archive.

@table @code
@item ADDLIB @var{archive} 
@itemx ADDLIB @var{archive} (@var{module}, @var{module}, @dots{} @var{module})
Add all the contents of @var{archive} (or, if specified, each named
@var{module} from @var{archive}) to the current archive.

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@item ADDMOD @var{file}, @var{file}, @dots{} @var{file}
@c FIXME! w/Replacement??  If so, like "ar r @var{archive} @var{names}"
@c        else like "ar q..."
Add each named @var{file} as a module in the current archive.

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@item CLEAR
Discard the contents of the current archive, cancelling the effect of
any operations since the last @code{SAVE}.  May be executed (with no
effect) even if  no current archive is specified.

@item CREATE @var{archive}
Creates an archive, and makes it the current archive (required for many
other commands).  The new archive is created with a temporary name; it
is not actually saved as @var{archive} until you use @code{SAVE}.
You can overwrite existing archives; similarly, the contents of any
existing file named @var{archive} will not be destroyed until @code{SAVE}.

@item DELETE @var{module}, @var{module}, @dots{} @var{module}
Delete each listed @var{module} from the current archive; equivalent to
@samp{ar -d @var{archive} @var{module} @dots{} @var{module}}.

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@item DIRECTORY @var{archive} (@var{module}, @dots{} @var{module})
@itemx DIRECTORY @var{archive} (@var{module}, @dots{} @var{module}) @var{outputfile}
List each named @var{module} present in @var{archive}.  The separate
command @code{VERBOSE} specifies the form of the output: when verbose
output is off, output is like that of @samp{ar -t @var{archive}
@var{module}@dots{}}.  When verbose output is on, the listing is like
@samp{ar -tv @var{archive} @var{module}@dots{}}.

Output normally goes to the standard output stream; however, if you
specify @var{outputfile} as a final argument, @code{ar} directs the
output to that file.

@item END
Exit from @code{ar}, with a @code{0} exit code to indicate successful
completion.  This command does not save the output file; if you have
changed the current archive since the last @code{SAVE} command, those
changes are lost.

@item EXTRACT @var{module}, @var{module}, @dots{} @var{module}
Extract each named @var{module} from the current archive, writing them
into the current directory as separate files.  Equivalent to @samp{ar -x
@var{archive} @var{module}@dots{}}.

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@ignore
@c FIXME Tokens but no commands???
@item FULLDIR

@item HELP
@end ignore

@item LIST
Display full contents of the current archive, in ``verbose'' style
regardless of the state of @code{VERBOSE}.  The effect is like @samp{ar
tv @var{archive}}).  (This single command is a GNU @code{ld}
enhancement, rather than present for MRI compatibility.)

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@item OPEN @var{archive}
Opens an existing archive for use as the current archive (required for
many other commands).  Any changes as the result of subsequent commands
will not actually affect @var{archive} until you next use @code{SAVE}.

@item REPLACE @var{module}, @var{module}, @dots{} @var{module}
In the current archive, replace each existing @var{module} (named in
the @code{REPLACE} arguments) from files in the current working directory.
To execute this command without errors, both the file, and the module in
the current archive, must exist. 

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@item VERBOSE
Toggle an internal flag governing the output from @code{DIRECTORY}.
When the flag is on, @code{DIRECTORY} output matches output from
@samp{ar -tv @dots{}}.

@item SAVE
Commit your changes to the current archive, and actually save it as a
file with the name specified in the last @code{CREATE} or @code{OPEN}
command. 

Requires prior use of @code{OPEN} or @code{CREATE}.

@cindex archive headers
If any files from @var{objfiles} are archives, display the archive
header information (in a format similar to @samp{ls -l}).  Besides the

@item -b @var{bfdname}
@cindex object code format
You can specify a particular object-code format for your object files as

@code{ranlib} generates an index to the contents of an archive, and

member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.  

You may use @samp{nm -s} or @samp{nm +print-armap} to list this index.

An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to

The GNU @code{size} utility lists the section sizes---and the total
size---for each of the object files @var{objfiles} in its argument list.
By default, one line of output is generated for each object file or each
module in an archive.

The command line options have the following meanings:
@table @code
@item @var{objfiles}@dots{}
The object files to be examined.

@item -A
@itemx -B
@itemx +format @var{compatibility}
@cindex size display format
Using one of these options, you can choose whether the output from GNU
@code{size} resembles output from System V @code{size} (using @samp{-A},
or @samp{+format sysv}), or Berkeley @code{size} (using @samp{-B}, or
@samp{+format berkeley}).  The default is the one-line format similar to
Berkeley's.  
@c Bonus for doc-source readers: you can also say +format=strange (or
@c anything else that starts with 's') for sysv, and +format=boring (or
@c anything else that starts with 'b') for Berkeley.

Here is an example of the Berkeley (default) format of output from
@code{size}: 
@smallexample
 eg$  size +format Berkeley ranlib size
text    data    bss     dec     hex     filename
294880  81920   11592   388392  5ed28   ranlib
294880  81920   11888   388688  5ee50   size
@end smallexample

@noindent
This is the same data, but displayed closer to System V conventions:

@smallexample
 eg$  size +format SysV ranlib size
ranlib  :
section         size         addr
.text         294880         8192       
.data          81920       303104       
.bss           11592       385024       
Total         388392    


size  :
section         size         addr
.text         294880         8192       
.data          81920       303104       
.bss           11888       385024       
Total         388688

@item +help
Show a summary of acceptable arguments and options.

@item -d
@itemx -o
@itemx -x
@itemx +radix @var{number}
@cindex size number format
@cindex radix for section sizes
Using one of these options, you can control whether the size of each
section is given in decimal (@samp{-d}, or @samp{+radix 10}); octal
(@samp{-o}, or @samp{+radix 8}); or hexadecimal (@samp{-x}, or
@samp{+radix 16}).  In @samp{+radix @var{number}}, only the three
values (8, 10, 16) are supported.  The total size is always given in two
radices; decimal and hexadecimal for @samp{-d} or @samp{-x} output, or
octal and hexadecimal if you're using @samp{-o}.

@item +target @var{bfdname}
@cindex object code format
You can specify a particular object-code format for @var{objfiles} as
@var{bfdname}.  This may not be necessary; @var{size} can
automatically recognize many formats.  @xref{objdump}, for information
on listing available formats.

@item -V
@itemx +version
Display version number information on @code{size} itself.

GNU @code{strip} will discard all symbols from object files
@var{objfiles}, if no options are specified; or only certain symbols,
depending on its command-line options.

@code{strip} will not execute unless at least one object file is listed.

@quotation
@emph{WARNING:} @code{strip} modifies the files named in its argument,
rather than writing modified copies under different names.
@end quotation

The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.

@table @code
@item -s
@itemx +strip-all 
@cindex all symbols, discarding
This is the default case: strip all symbol entries from @var{objfiles}.

@item -g
@itemx -S
@itemx +strip-debug 
@cindex debugging symbols, discarding
Discard only debugging symbol information from @var{objfiles}.

@item -x
@itemx +discard-all 
@cindex local symbols, discarding
Discard all symbols local to each file in @var{objfiles}.
@emph{WARNING:} Note that @code{+discard-all} discards only @emph{local}
symbols, in spite of its name.

@item -X
@itemx +discard-locals 
Discard local symbols starting with @samp{L} from each file in
@var{objfiles}.  (Some compilers produce internally-used symbols that
begin with @samp{L}.)

@item -T @var{bfdname}
@cindex object code format
You can specify a particular object-code format @var{bfdname} for
@var{objfiles}.  This may not be necessary; @var{strip} can automatically
recognize many formats.  @xref{objdump}, for information on listing
available formats.
