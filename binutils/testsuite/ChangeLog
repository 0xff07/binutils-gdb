	* binutils/testsuite: Initial creation of binutils/testsuite.
	Migrated dejagnu testcases and support files for testing nm to
	binutils/testsuite from deja-gnu.  These files were moved "as is"
	with no modifications.  This migration is part of a major overhaul
	of dejagnu.  The modifications to these testcases, etc., which
	will allow them to work with the new version of dejagnu will be
	made in a future update.
