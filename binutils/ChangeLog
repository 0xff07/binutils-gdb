	* objdump.c (dump_elf_stabs): New feature: --stabs prints out a
	.stab section from an ELF file.  Installed under #ifdef

	* copy.c, is-strip.c, not-strip.c, maybe-strip.c, Makefile.in:
	Make the same change that we earlier did for ar/ranlib:
	Generate two different binaries for strip and copy and use
	a global variable with different values to distinguish
	ostrip from copy.  (-1 means to use argv[0] to decide,
	so you can get the old behavior, but it is no longer the default).
	* copy.c (copy_file):  Set EXEC_P of output bfd if input is so.
	* copy.c (main):  If is_strip==-1, compare last 5 chars
	of argv[0], not the whole path.

	now failing if asked for a duplicate section.
	* strip.c, ostrip.c:  Removed obsolete files.
	* ar.c, not-ranlib.c, maybe-ranlib.c:
	Change encoding of is_ranlib variable to be consistent

	type operands, as used by branch instructions.
	* nm.c:  Delegate printing of symbols to BFD,
