	* Makefile.in: new targets binutils.dvi, binutils.info

	* binutils.texinfo: remove most remaining FIXME's, delete
	references to __.SYMDEF by name

	* objdump.c (print_address) Print addresses nicely.

Mon Oct  7 11:31:05 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ar.c, Makefile.in, new files {is,not,maybe}-ranlib.c:
	Make two different binaries for ar and ranlib, instead of
	distinguishing them at run time using argv[0].
	(Old behavior is still available if you "make ar_with_ranlib",
	but it is not the default.)
	* ranlib.sh (new):  An alternative one-line
	shell implementation of ranlib.

	* objdump.c:  Cope with renames of a few BFD types & enums.

Fri Oct  4 19:08:09 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

	* binutils.texinfo: add new file (rudimentary docn)

Mon Sep 30 12:30:39 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* config/hmake-news: Add new file (for Sony NEWSOS3).
	* bucomm.c (fatal):  Conditionally compile fatal() depending on
	MISSING_VFPRINTF, and don't confuse the issue with NO_VARARGS.
	* objdump.c (dump_headers):  Trivial output format change.
	* objdump.c (display_info): Loop over integers, not enums,
	to appease old compilers.

        *objdump.c *nm.c *copy.c :hanged some types to work with 64 bit object files

Thu May 16 16:06:55 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygint.cygnus.com)
     from bother
	* objdump.c (print_address): Make disasembled output more
	consistent with gdb and as: Add 0x when printing hex.
	Don't print extra leading zeros.
	Attempt to not print "filename.o".
	* objdump.c: Add some enum-to-int casts to accomodate old compilers.


Fri May  3 22:21:44 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygint.cygnus.com)

	* copy.c:  Change =& constructs to = &, since they confuse older
	C compilers.
