Sat Nov  7 15:06:13 1992  david d `zoo' zuhn  (zoo at cirdan.cygnus.com)

        * ar.c (extract_file): utime needs a pointer to a utimbuf

	* Makefile.in: handle -I includes better, adding $(BASEDIR)/bfd to

Wed Aug  5 11:25:27 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

Mon Jul 27 16:28:08 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* objdump.c (display_info, display_info_table):  Call

Thu Jun 11 01:19:06 1992  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* objdump.c (dump_elf_stabs): New feature: --stabs prints out a
	.stab section from an ELF file.  Installed under #ifdef
	ELF_STAB_DISPLAY so it can be easily disabled, since it requires
	bfd-internals header files and such.
	* objdump.1, binutils.texi:  Update for --stabs.  Also fix
	objdump's doc to use -- rather than + for long options.
	(FIXME:  Not yet fixed everywhere in binutils.texinfo.)

Fri May 22 13:40:37 1992  Per Bothner  (bothner@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Use srcdir instead of VPATH in ldgram/ldlex

Tue Nov 19 19:20:43 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* README:  Mention MINIMIZE flag for bfd's make.

Mon Nov 18 12:05:37 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* README:  Various improvements.

Sun Nov 17 23:40:59 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Bump to version 1.92.
	* version.c, Makefile.in:  Get version string from Makefile.
	* copy.c, is-strip.c, not-strip.c, maybe-strip.c, Makefile.in:
	Make the same change that we earlier did for ar/ranlib:
	Generate two different binaries for strip and copy and use
	a global variable with different values to distinguish
	ostrip from copy.  (-1 means to use argv[0] to decide,
	so you can get the old behavior, but it is no longer the default).
	* copy.c (copy_file):  Set EXEC_P of output bfd if input is so.
	* copy.c (main):  If is_strip==-1, compare last 5 chars
	of argv[0], not the whole path.
	* copy.c (main): Return 0, not 1.
	* copy.c (setup_sections):  Fix due to change in bfd_make_section
	now failing if asked for a duplicate section.
	* strip.c, ostrip.c:  Removed obsolete files.
	* ar.c, not-ranlib.c, maybe-ranlib.c:
	Change encoding of is_ranlib variable to be consistent
	with is_strip for strip.copy (i.e -1 to means use argv[0]).

Thu Nov 14 20:11:02 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* version.c (program_version): Update to version 1.92.

Tue Nov 12 16:17:53 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

Thu Nov  7 08:55:56 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at cygnus.com)

	* am29k-pinsn.c: Fixed bug in mtacc, dmac and fmac instruction
	encodings. (Thaks to David Wood)

Sun Nov  3 14:50:23 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in ($(DIST_NAME).tar.Z), TODO:  Various fixes.
	* ar.c (get_pos_bfd): Fix to handling of before/after
	positioning options.
	* bucomm.c (fatal):  MISSING_VFPRINTF is no longer an issue,
	since libiberty contains vfprintf etc if otherwise missing.
	* m68k-pinsn.c (print_insn_arg):  Support BB/BW/BL
	type operands, as used by branch instructions.
	* nm.c:  Delegate printing of symbols to BFD,
	by using bfd_print_symbol to do the formatting.

Mon Oct 28 11:20:47 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at cygnus.com)

	* ar.c (write_archive.c): added unlink before rename since some
	systems can't rename onto an existant file.

Mon Oct 21 09:47:23 1991  Steve Chamberlain  (steve at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* nm.c: now doesn't crash if a symbol with no section and no
	SEC_ABS appears.

	* configure.in:  Revise to symlink sysdep.h to ../bfd/hosts/h-xxx.h.
	Change some config names to match other dirs.
	* *.c:  Include bfd.h before sysdep.h, so ansidecl and PROTO()
	get defined first.
	* Makefile.in:  Use -I. to get sysdep.h.

Wed Oct  9 22:42:56 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* nm.c (print_symbols):  Handle NULL name field of symbol.

Mon Oct  7 11:31:05 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ar.c, Makefile.in, new files {is,not,maybe}-ranlib.c:
	Make two different binaries for ar and ranlib, instead of
	distinguishing them at run time using argv[0].
	(Old behavior is still available if you "make ar_with_ranlib",
	but it is not the default.)
	* ranlib.sh (new):  An alternative one-line
	shell implementation of ranlib.

Fri Oct  4 21:49:44 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* objdump.c:  Cope with renames of a few BFD types & enums.

Fri Oct  4 19:08:09 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

Mon Sep 30 12:30:39 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* config/hmake-news: Add new file (for Sony NEWSOS3).
	* bucomm.c (fatal):  Conditionally compile fatal() depending on
	MISSING_VFPRINTF, and don't confuse the issue with NO_VARARGS.

	* objdump.c (display_info): Loop over integers, not enums,
	to appease old compilers.

	consistent with gdb and as: Add 0x when printing hex.
