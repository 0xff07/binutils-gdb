# .Sanitize for devo/ld/config

# Each directory to survive its way into a release will need a file
# like this one called "./.Sanitize".  All keyword lines must exist,
# and must exist in the order specified by this file.  Each directory
# in the tree will be processed, top down, in the following order.

# Hash started lines like this one are comments and will be deleted
# before anything else is done.  Blank lines will also be squashed
# out.

# The lines between the "Do-first:" line and the "Things-to-keep:"
# line are executed as a /bin/sh shell script before anything else is
# done in this directory.

Do-first:

arc_files="arc-elf.mt"

if ( echo $* | grep keep\-arc > /dev/null ) ; then
	keep_these_too="${arc_files} ${keep_these_too}"
else
	lose_these_too="${arc_files} ${lose_these_too}"
fi

rce_files="rce-aout.mt"

if ( echo $* | grep keep\-rce > /dev/null ) ; then
	keep_these_too="${rce_files} ${keep_these_too}"
else
	lose_these_too="${rce_files} ${lose_these_too}"
fi

# All files listed between the "Things-to-keep:" line and the
# "Do-last:" line will be kept.  All other files will be removed.
# Directories listed in this section will have their own Sanitize
# called.  Directories not listed will be removed in their entirety
# with rm -rf.
