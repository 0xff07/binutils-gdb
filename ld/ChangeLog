	* Makefile.in: new targets ld.mm, ld.me

Mon Oct 14 17:27:24 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, ldtemplate:  Need to use separate scripts
	for -n and -N options.  Yet more complication.

Fri Oct 11 22:40:46 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Avoid using $< in explicit Make rules (it doesn't
	work).  Add some lines to avoid Sun Make VPATH bugs.

	* news.sc: Add alignment for data segment.
	* ldtemplate: Add (yet another) script to get for -n or -N
	options.  (These need different alignment than ZMAGIC files.)
	* Makefile.in:  Add stuff for new foo.xn scripts.
	These are generated by replacing "ALIGN(0x...00)" by ".".

Fri Oct 11 15:43:04 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: new targets ld.ms, ld-index.ms
	ld.texinfo: remove tabs, other cleanups for texi2roff

Fri Oct 11 13:51:54 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldmain.c (main): Make config.magic_demand_paged be true
	by default.  Don't the WP_TEXT and D_PAGED flags of
	output_bfd here; it's too late, so set it when output_bfd
	is created (in ldlang.c).  Also fix setting of EXEC_P flag
	* ldlang.c (ldlang_open_output):  Set output_bfd->flags here.
	* ldlang.c: Remove some duplicate extern declarations.
	* ldgram.y: Fixes to -N and -n options.
	* Makefile.in:  Recognize upper case letters in sed script
	to remove assignments from script files.
	* ldtemplate:  Don't assukme that -N or -n options
	imply use of -r script.
	* mkscript.c:  Tweaking to correctly handle \n and \\ in input.

	* ldtemplate: include bfd.h before sysdep.h.

Fri Oct 11 04:24:45 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	Restructure configuration scheme for bfd, binutils, ld.

	* include/sys/h-*.h:  Move to bfd/hosts/h-*.h.
	* configure.in:  Revise to symlink sysdep.h to ../bfd/hosts/h-xxx.h.
	Change some config names to match other dirs.
	* *.c:  Include bfd.h before sysdep.h, so ansidecl and PROTO()
	get defined first.
	* config/:  Rename some config files to match up h-*.h names.
	Remove all the HOST_SYS definitions from the config files.

Tue Oct  8 16:00:57 1991  Per Bothner  (bothner at cygnus.com)

	* ldexp.h, ldlang.h: Change enum boolean -> enum bfd_boolean.
	* ldtemplate: Remove ldfile_add_library_path calls;
	just use the SEARCH_DIR commands in the script files.
	* Makefile.in: Add LIB_PATH macro, which if set is used to replace
	the SEARCH_DIR commands in the scripts (using ugly sed magic).
	This is primarily intended for cross-linking, where you would
	place libaries in a different place than native libraries.
	Also, emulations made from ldtemplate now use $(srcdir).
	* ldglda29k.sc:  Change SEARCH_DIR commands to a conventional
	form; people can use the Makefile's LIB_PATH to override.

Tue Oct  8 14:51:21 1991  Roland H. Pesch  (pesch at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: fix target ld.dvi, add target ld.info
	ld.texinfo: make info filename ld.info

Fri Oct  4 21:51:58 1991  John Gilmore  (gnu at cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Avoid using $< in non-suffix rules (breaks on Sun
	Make). 
	* ldfile.c, ldlang.c, ldmain.c, ldwrite.c:  Cope with renames of a
	few BFD types & enums.
