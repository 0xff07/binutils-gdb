	Restructure configuration scheme for bfd, binutils, ld.

	* include/sys/h-*.h:  Move to bfd/hosts/h-*.h.
	* configure.in:  Revise to symlink sysdep.h to ../bfd/hosts/h-xxx.h.
	Change some config names to match other dirs.
	* *.c:  Include bfd.h before sysdep.h, so ansidecl and PROTO()
	get defined first.
	* config/:  Rename some config files to match up h-*.h names.
	Remove all the HOST_SYS definitions from the config files.

	* ldexp.h, ldlang.h: Change enum boolean -> enum bfd_boolean.
	* ldtemplate: Remove ldfile_add_library_path calls;
	just use the SEARCH_DIR commands in the script files.
	* Makefile.in: Add LIB_PATH macro, which if set is used to replace
	the SEARCH_DIR commands in the scripts (using ugly sed magic).
	This is primarily intended for cross-linking, where you would
	place libaries in a different place than native libraries.
	Also, emulations made from ldtemplate now use $(srcdir).
	* ldglda29k.sc:  Change SEARCH_DIR commands to a conventional
	form; people can use the Makefile's LIB_PATH to override.

	* Makefile.in: fix target ld.dvi, add target ld.info
	ld.texinfo: make info filename ld.info

	* Makefile.in:  Avoid using $< in non-suffix rules (breaks on Sun
	Make). 
	* ldfile.c, ldlang.c, ldmain.c, ldwrite.c:  Cope with renames of a
	few BFD types & enums.
