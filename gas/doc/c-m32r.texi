The Mitsubishi M32R version of @code{@value{AS}} has a few machine
dependent options.

@cindex M32R architecture options
@code{@value{AS}} can assemble code for several different members of the
Mitsubishi M32R family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for
the M32R microprocessor.  This option may be used to change the default
to the M32RX microprocessor, which adds some more instructions to the
basic M32R instruction set.
