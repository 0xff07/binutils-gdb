* rcsid's should be conspicuously absent until someone explains to me
  how to use them constructively without affecting diffs from remote
  sites.  If you can, then I will become an active supporter of
  rcsid's.

* "diff -u" patches preferred.  "diff -c" patches accepted.  All other
  patches will be returned.

* all files have been formatted with indent-region based on
  gas-format.el.  Please adhere to to it. Indent profiles that closely
  coincide will be gleefully accepted.
