# Each directory to survive it's way into a release will need a file
# like this one called "./.Sanitize".  All keyword lines must exist,
# and must exist in the order specified by this file.  Each directory
# in the tree will be processed, top down, in the following order.

# Hash started lines like this one are comments and will be deleted
# before anything else is done.  Blank lines will also be squashed
# out.

# The lines between the "Do-first:" line and the "Things-to-keep:"
# line are executed as a /bin/sh shell script before anything else is
# done in this 

Do-first:

echo Sanitizing `pwd`...

# All files listed between the "Things-to-keep:" line and the
# "Files-to-sed:" line will be kept.  All other files will be removed.
# Directories listed in this section will have their own Sanitize
# called.  Directories not listed will be removed in their entirety
# with rm -rf.

#
# 	* flonum-const.c: renamed flonum-konst.c to stop dos name
# 	conflict.
#
# Revision 1.10  1992/02/22  20:44:46  sac
# 	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
# 	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
# 	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
# 	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
# 	expressions. Also easier to read now.
# 	* listing.c: Put back defuns
# 	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
# 	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
# 	rather than pukes.
# 	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
# 	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
# 	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
# 	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
# 	fill in the timestamp.
# 	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
# 	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
# 	can translate from them to the coff types.
# 	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
# 	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.
#
# Now compiles for sparc aout, 68k aout (MRI and MIT syntax),
# 29k coff.
#
# So far works as replacement for sparc and 68k /bin/as.
