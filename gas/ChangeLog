	* obj-vms.c (obj_aout_stab):  Add code to generate listing file.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_typedef_parse): Add alias to correctly handle certain
	  types of malformed stabs.  Change parsing algorithm so that we are
	  more certain of having all of the information that we need on hand.
	* obj-vms.c (final_forward_reference):  New function, used to help
	  resolve the data types of as many struct elements as possible
	  when some part of the struct is not fully defined by the compiler.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_LSYM_Parse):  Correctly handle case of continuation
	  stabs directives.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_write_object_file): Define all vtable psects
	  as symbols as well in the object file.  Look for external functions
	  that start with "__vt.", and turn them into variables, since the
	  g++ compiler is incapable of doing this.
	* tc-vax.c: Add '1' option for backward compatibility with older GCC
	  versions.
	* bignum-copy.c (bignum_copy): Fix bug where we pad with zeroes.
	* input-scrub.c (as_where): Fix bug where as would crash if we did not
	  have the name of the source file yet.

	(had_errors, had_warnings): Provide prototypes for ANSI C even if
	NO_STDARG.
	(as_bad, as_fatal, as_tsktsk, as_warn): For GNU C version 2,
	declare with format attribute for -Wformat checking.

Wed Dec 30 10:18:57 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* app.c, config/tc-*.c: Don't include read.h, since it is already
	included by as.h.

	* These are based on patches from Minh Tran-le
	<mtranle@paris.intellicorp.com>.
	* configure.in (i[34]86-ibm-aix*): Accept i486 for host.  Use
	obj_format coffbfd and gas_target i386coff for target.
	(i[34]86-*-isc*): New host (uses sysv).
	* config/i386aix.mt: Removed (no longer used).

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (had_lineno, had_reloc): Removed.
	(size_section): Restored sanity check.
	(do_relocs_for): Base section address on s_paddr rather than
	computing it.  Adjust a29k R_IHIHALF special case to account for
	section paddr (used to require paddr to be zero).  If there are no
	reclos, set s_relptr to 0.  Set relocation size in object_headers.
	(fill_section): Always set s_vaddr here, removing
	ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS case.  Force s_scnptr for bss to 0.  Don't set

	fill_section before do_relocs_for and do_linenos_for.
	(obj_coff_section): Handle optional quoted second argument giving
	section characteristics.
	(obj_coff_bss): Added to handle .bss.
	(obj_coff_ident): Added to handle .ident (puts string in .comment
	section).
	(obj_coff_lcomm): Put common symbols in .bss, not .data.
	(fixup_mdeps): Change to segment.  Call frag_wane after
	md_convert_frag.
	(fixup_segment): Explicitly check S_IS_COMMON before making 386
	adjustment (already happened only for common symbols, but this is
	clearer).
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h (OBJ_COFF_OMIT_OPTIONAL_HEADER): Define.

	never set segment address for SEG_E2 (.bss) and don't write out
	SEG_E2 contents.  Set .init and .fini sections to STYP_TEXT.
	(obj_coff_endef): Don't merge labels or symbols awaiting forward
	definitions, and don't merge tags with non-tags.  Check for .bf
	rather than just checking whether the second character is b and
	the third character is f.
	(obj_coff_val): gcc can generate values which we don't handle
	correctly; discard information for now, since it only affects the
	debugging information.
	(tag_find_or_name): Don't insert tags in the symbol table.
	(yank_symbols): Don't merge labels.
	(write_object_file): Don't define SUB_SEGMENT_ALIGN if it is
	already defined.  Fill subsegments with NOP_OPCODE, not 0.  Don't
	set segment address if ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS.
	(obj_coff_section): Accept and ignore a trailing quoted string, as
	used in AT&T i386 syntax.

	* Added WARN_SIGNED_OVERFLOW_WORD define to give an error if any
	.word is < -32768 or > 32767.  The -J flag causes the error to be

	really strange things with things like fbge,a 

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.

	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make

	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.

	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.

	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more

	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

	* tc-i386.c: tc-i386.c: added handling of the following opcodes:
	  i/o opcodes - inb, inw, outb and outw.  string manipulation with
	  att syntax - scmp, slod, smov, ssca, ssto.

	* obj-coff.c: (for aix386) Moved the symbols .text, .data and .bss
	  to just after .file .

	  In obj_crawl_symbol_chain() where it tries to put the external
	  symbols apart, with the condition:
	    (!S_IS_DEFINED(symbolP) &&
	     !S_IS_DEBUG(symbolP) &&
	     !SF_GET_STATICS(symbolP))
	  it was moving too many symbols out. So I switch it back to the
	  condition:
	    (S_GET_STORAGE_CLASS(symbolP) == C_EXT && !SF_GET_FUNCTION(symbolP))

	  In obj_emit_relocations() added the conditional on KEEP_RELOC_INFO
	  so that we don't use the F_RELFLG which make the linker complain
	  that somebody has stripped the relocation info.

	  Also, the AIX ld program require that the relocation table
	  is sorted by r_vaddr like the standard ATT assembler does.

	  [he also changed the sizeof(struct ...)'s into the coff
	  style FOOSZ macros.  I'm not sure this is right, but I can't
	  remember why.  xoxorich.]

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

	* tc-m88k.[hc]: pulled in from hack's unfinished work.  These
	  aren't yet integrated.

	* tc-i860.[hc]: blew off the dust.  Something must still be done
	  about conflicting relocation types.

	* tc-ns32k.c: Replaced previous tc_aout_fix_to_chars stub with the
	  real thing.

	* tc-i960.c, tc-sparc.c: white space and comments only.

	* tc-a29k.h: delete duplicate macro definition.

	* new file atof-ns32k.c copied from hack's last unreleased gas.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.
				       
	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
