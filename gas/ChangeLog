Wed Mar 17 16:44:06 1993  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* app.c (do_scrub_next_char): Added new state, 9, to avoid

	* expr.c, write.c: Rewrote assert expressions to not use multiple
	lines; I don't think that can be done portably.
	* config/tc-mips.c (macro): Use $AT if target register is zero in

	* expr.c (operand): If character other than comma or newline is a
	logical end-of-line character, use the newline case.
	From Eric Youngdale:
	(operand): Set X_add_number field for floating-point numbers.
	(operand): Treat zero byte as end-of-operand.

	* configure.in (per-target): Look for with_bfd_assembler option.
	For now, only accept "no", until the merge is done.

	Merged changes from Eric Youngdale (youngdale@v6550c.nrl.navy.mil):
	* as.c, flonum-konst.c, hex-value.c, input-file.c, version.c,
	  config/obj-aout.h, config/obj-vms.c: VMS -> HO_VMS.
	* read.c: Finish conversion to S_* macros in the VMS only
	  parts of the program. Add "const" modifier to hex_value.
	* as.c, read.c, symbols.c, write.c: Change "ifdef VMS" to
	  "ifdef OBJ_VMS".
	* expr.c: Add "const" modifier to hex_value.
	* symbols.c: Finish conversion to S_* macros in the VMS only
	  parts of the program.  Add "const" modifier to
	  md_[long,short]_jump_size. Remove declaration of const_flag
	  (which will be declared in obj-vms.h).
	* write.c: Add "const" modifier to md_[long,short]_jump_size.
	  Fix arguments to VMS_write_object_file.
	* config-gas.com: New file.  Script for VMS systems to set up the
	  configuration to build gas for VMS, and create config.status.

	  stabs directives.
	* obj-vms.c:  Define macros COPY_LONG and COPY_SHORT which

	* obj-vms.c (obj_aout_stab):  Add code to generate listing file.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_typedef_parse): Add alias to correctly handle certain
	  types of malformed stabs.  Change parsing algorithm so that we are
	  more certain of having all of the information that we need on hand.
	* obj-vms.c (final_forward_reference):  New function, used to help
	  resolve the data types of as many struct elements as possible
	  when some part of the struct is not fully defined by the compiler.

	  stabs directives.
	* obj-vms.c (VMS_write_object_file): Define all vtable psects
	  as symbols as well in the object file.  Look for external functions
	  that start with "__vt.", and turn them into variables, since the
	  g++ compiler is incapable of doing this.
	* tc-vax.c: Add '1' option for backward compatibility with older GCC
	  versions.
	* bignum-copy.c (bignum_copy): Fix bug where we pad with zeroes.
	* input-scrub.c (as_where): Fix bug where as would crash if we did not
	  have the name of the source file yet.

Mon Jan  4 05:17:26 1993  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cygnus.com)

	(had_errors, had_warnings): Provide prototypes for ANSI C even if
	NO_STDARG.
	(as_bad, as_fatal, as_tsktsk, as_warn): For GNU C version 2,
	declare with format attribute for -Wformat checking.

Wed Dec 30 10:18:57 1992  Ian Lance Taylor  (ian@cygnus.com)

	* app.c, config/tc-*.c: Don't include read.h, since it is already
	included by as.h.

	* These are based on patches from Minh Tran-le
	<mtranle@paris.intellicorp.com>.
	* configure.in (i[34]86-ibm-aix*): Accept i486 for host.  Use
	obj_format coffbfd and gas_target i386coff for target.

	* config/obj-coffbfd.c (had_lineno, had_reloc): Removed.
	(size_section): Restored sanity check.
	(do_relocs_for): Base section address on s_paddr rather than
	computing it.  Adjust a29k R_IHIHALF special case to account for
	section paddr (used to require paddr to be zero).  If there are no
	reclos, set s_relptr to 0.  Set relocation size in object_headers.
	(fill_section): Always set s_vaddr here, removing
	ZERO_BASED_SEGMENTS case.  Force s_scnptr for bss to 0.  Don't set

	fill_section before do_relocs_for and do_linenos_for.
	(obj_coff_section): Handle optional quoted second argument giving
	section characteristics.
	(obj_coff_bss): Added to handle .bss.
	(obj_coff_ident): Added to handle .ident (puts string in .comment
	section).
	(obj_coff_lcomm): Put common symbols in .bss, not .data.
	(fixup_mdeps): Change to segment.  Call frag_wane after
	md_convert_frag.
	(fixup_segment): Explicitly check S_IS_COMMON before making 386
	adjustment (already happened only for common symbols, but this is
	clearer).
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h (OBJ_COFF_OMIT_OPTIONAL_HEADER): Define.

	never set segment address for SEG_E2 (.bss) and don't write out
	SEG_E2 contents.  Set .init and .fini sections to STYP_TEXT.
	(obj_coff_endef): Don't merge labels or symbols awaiting forward
	definitions, and don't merge tags with non-tags.  Check for .bf
	rather than just checking whether the second character is b and
	the third character is f.
	(obj_coff_val): gcc can generate values which we don't handle
	correctly; discard information for now, since it only affects the
	debugging information.
	(tag_find_or_name): Don't insert tags in the symbol table.
	(yank_symbols): Don't merge labels.
	(write_object_file): Don't define SUB_SEGMENT_ALIGN if it is

Fri Mar 13 08:03:03 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac@thepub.cygnus.com)

	* flonum-const.c: renamed flonum-konst.c to stop dos name
	conflict.

Thu Mar 12 04:42:38 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* tc-m68k.h, te-sun3.h: moved LOCAL_LABELS_FB definition from
	  tc-m68k.h to te-sun3.h. 

Wed Mar 11 23:32:42 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: vxworks68 gets te-sun3.h.

	* expr.c: remove limitation that local_labels_dollar or
	  local_labels_fb must be < 10.

	* symbols.c: remove local_labels_dollar, replace with a function
	  interface for a sparse array.  All users adjusted.

	* te-sun3.h: add LOCAL_LABELS_DOLLAR.

Sat Mar  7 00:06:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* doc/Makefile.in: commented out line for building as-all.texinfo.
	  This is temporary.

	* doc/as.texinfo, doc/as-all.texinfo: added menu item hooks.

Fri Mar  6 21:57:18 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added check target.

Tue Mar  3 15:45:56 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added tooldir and program_prefix.

Sun Mar  1 04:43:19 1992  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann@cygnus.com)

	* write.{c,h} (fix_new): Make these declarations consistent.

Sat Feb 29 13:59:10 1992  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (strerror.o): Add rule so that broken Sun make can
	work in subdirs.

Wed Feb 26 19:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at thepub.cygnus.com)

	* read.c, obj-coffbfd.c : fix h8300 specific bit rot

	* expr.c (operand): if can't work out what sort of operand it is,
	then look through FLT_CHARS for a hint.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Tue Feb 25 14:17:15 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a 

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make
	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

Fri Feb 21 06:21:07 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: put header files before C source for TAGS; remove
	  references to non-existent syscalls.h.

	* read.c, write.c subsegs.c: back out the .bss changes.

	* obj-aout.c: do not include stab.gnu.h if NO_LISTING.

	* tc-i860.c, a.out.gnu.h: move i860 relocs to a proper place.

	* a.out.h: removed.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  Minh Tran-Le (TRANLE@INTELLICORP.COM)

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

	* tc-i386.c: tc-i386.c: added handling of the following opcodes:
	  i/o opcodes - inb, inw, outb and outw.  string manipulation with
	  att syntax - scmp, slod, smov, ssca, ssto.

	* obj-coff.c: (for aix386) Moved the symbols .text, .data and .bss
	  to just after .file .

	  In obj_crawl_symbol_chain() where it tries to put the external
	  symbols apart, with the condition:
	    (!S_IS_DEFINED(symbolP) &&
	     !S_IS_DEBUG(symbolP) &&
	     !SF_GET_STATICS(symbolP))
	  it was moving too many symbols out. So I switch it back to the
	  condition:
	    (S_GET_STORAGE_CLASS(symbolP) == C_EXT && !SF_GET_FUNCTION(symbolP))

	  In obj_emit_relocations() added the conditional on KEEP_RELOC_INFO
	  so that we don't use the F_RELFLG which make the linker complain
	  that somebody has stripped the relocation info.

	  Also, the AIX ld program require that the relocation table
	  is sorted by r_vaddr like the standard ATT assembler does.

	  [he also changed the sizeof(struct ...)'s into the coff
	  style FOOSZ macros.  I'm not sure this is right, but I can't
	  remember why.  xoxorich.]

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

	* tc-m88k.[hc]: pulled in from hack's unfinished work.  These
	  aren't yet integrated.

	* tc-i860.[hc]: blew off the dust.  Something must still be done
	  about conflicting relocation types.

	* tc-ns32k.c: Replaced previous tc_aout_fix_to_chars stub with the
	  real thing.

	* tc-i960.c, tc-sparc.c: white space and comments only.

	* tc-a29k.h: delete duplicate macro definition.

	* new file atof-ns32k.c copied from hack's last unreleased gas.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.
				       
	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
