Tue May 26 16:47:56 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac@thepub.cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-a29k.c: lint
	* listing.c, expr.c: patches from Andrew Smith

Mon Apr 27 13:13:31 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* as.c, write.c: use -K rather than -k for the broken word warning
	  option.

Tue Apr 21 13:35:30 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: do not print recursion lines.

Wed Apr 15 21:19:31 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: the tooldir copy of gas goes directly in tooldir.

Tue Apr 14 14:50:22 1992  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)

	* write.c (write_object_file): For b.out format, round up section
	start addresses to match required alignment.

Thu Apr  9 05:45:29 1992  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)

	* Makefile.in (install): Install into $(tooldir)/bin, since that's
	where gcc looks for it.

Tue Apr  7 15:12:15 1992  Sean Eric Fagan  (sef@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in:  Changed some lines to be less confusing for some
	makes.

	* input-file.c:  Conditionalize on _IOFBF, not VMS.

	* read.c, write.c:  Change a series of ifdef/elif to
	ifdef/else/ifdef etc.

Fri Mar 27 12:21:16 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* symbols.c (fb_label_init): fix sizeof to memset.

Fri Mar 13 15:45:44 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: install the man page.

	* Makefile.in: pass down MAKEINFO explicitly on info.

Fri Mar 13 08:03:03 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac@thepub.cygnus.com)

	* flonum-const.c: renamed flonum-konst.c to stop dos name
	conflict.

Wed Mar 11 23:32:42 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: vxworks68 gets te-sun3.h.

	* expr.c: remove limitation that local_labels_dollar or
	  local_labels_fb must be < 10.

	* symbols.c: remove local_labels_dollar, replace with a function
	  interface for a sparse array.  All users adjusted.

Fri Mar  6 21:57:18 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added check target.

Tue Mar  3 15:45:56 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added tooldir and program_prefix.

Sun Mar  1 04:43:19 1992  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann@cygnus.com)

	* write.{c,h} (fix_new): Make these declarations consistent.

Sat Feb 29 13:59:10 1992  Michael Tiemann  (tiemann@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (strerror.o): Add rule so that broken Sun make can
	work in subdirs.

Wed Feb 26 19:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at thepub.cygnus.com)

	* read.c, obj-coffbfd.c : fix h8300 specific bit rot

	* expr.c (operand): if can't work out what sort of operand it is,
	then look through FLT_CHARS for a hint.

Wed Feb 26 18:04:40 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Tue Feb 25 14:17:15 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a 

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make
	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

Fri Feb 21 06:21:07 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: put header files before C source for TAGS; remove
	  references to non-existent syscalls.h.

	* read.c, write.c subsegs.c: back out the .bss changes.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  Minh Tran-Le (TRANLE@INTELLICORP.COM)

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.
				       
	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
