	processor/opcode mismatch, so reword the error message.
	(md_assemble): If no CPU has been set (even if FPU/PMMU
	characteristics have been), default to 68020.  Don't need extra
	quotes around error string.

Fri Jul 31 12:26:34 1992  Jim Wilson  (wilson@sphagnum.cygnus.com)

	* read.c (potable): Revert sac's incorrect change made Jul 13.

	the BSS segment in much the same was as stuff in the DATA segment.

	* expr.c(expr): allow SEG_REGISTER in expressions.
	* read.c(pseudo_set): register expressions can be the source of a
	set.
	* subsegs.c (subseg_new): Now -R forces all changes to SEG_DATA to

	* write.c (write_object_file): If a.out don't use the old way for
	-R.
	* config/obj-a.out (s_sect): complain if the user tries to use a

	fixes a bug in -R where relocations were being lost.

Thu Apr  9 05:45:29 1992  Ken Raeburn  (Raeburn@Cygnus.COM)

	* Makefile.in (install): Install into $(tooldir)/bin, since that's
	where gcc looks for it.

Tue Apr  7 15:12:15 1992  Sean Eric Fagan  (sef@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: added check target.

Tue Mar  3 15:45:56 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: removed traces of namesubdir,
	  -subdirs, $(subdir), $(unsubdir), some rcs triggers.  Forced
	  copyrights to '92, changed some from Cygnus to FSF.

Tue Feb 25 14:17:15 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a 

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on
	the H8.
	* config/tc-h8300.[ch] : fix bugs reported by HMSI, and make
	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

Fri Feb 21 06:21:07 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: put header files before C source for TAGS; remove
	  references to non-existent syscalls.h.

	* read.c, write.c subsegs.c: back out the .bss changes.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  Minh Tran-Le (TRANLE@INTELLICORP.COM)

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.
				       
	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
