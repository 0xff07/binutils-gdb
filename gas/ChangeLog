	than install_operand.

	files, they might be included twice.

Tue Feb 25 14:17:15 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* expr.c: If an expression is single comma, then return with
	SEG_ABSENT rather than an error - since the sparc front end does
	really strange things with things like fbge,a 

	* as.h: include bfd.h if using many sections
	* expr.c: LOCAL_LABELS_FB had been changed to lower case - so
	local labels didn't work.
	* listing.c (list_symbol_table): don't core dump when there's no
	symbol there.
	* write.c, write.h: call fix_new with the right number of args on

	errors nices

Sat Feb 22 12:26:28 1992  Steve Chamberlain  (sac at rtl.cygnus.com)

	* app.c: MRI compatibility - allow single quote to start a string.
	* as.c: fix typo recently introduced.
	* as.h : Don't include aout/reloc.h - it's not right for COFF!
	* expr.c: Much rewriting, to accomodate MRI syntax for
	expressions. Also easier to read now.
	* listing.c: Put back defuns
	* read.c: modified to accept MRI syntax, put back listing pseudo
	ops so that an assembler built with NO_LISTING ignores list ops
	rather than pukes.
	* write.c, write.h: fixs - only keep a reloc type in a fix if the target
	machine is a SPARC or a 29K.
	* config/obj-aout.c: added s_sect pseudo op
	* config/obj-coffbfd.c: lints, set the filehdr flags right and
	fill in the timestamp.
	* config/obj-coffbfd.h: Since we don't include aout/reloc.h
	anymore, define all the relocs which the tc-<x> bit will use so we
	can translate from them to the coff types.
	* config/tc-a29k.c: reloc_type isn't ane enum any more
	* config/tc-m68k.c: Added NO_RELOC definition.

	* symbols.c (local_label_name): symbols now start with ^A.

	* read.c, subsegs.c, write.c obj-coff.c: added handling of
	  `.bss` pseudo op for unitialized data. The new gcc (1.37.9x)
	  generate these sections.  .align: will use NOP_OPCODE or 0
	  for padding. This is just for being nice to the
	  disassembler.

	* expr.c (operand): changed to generate local label "\001L0"
	  starting with a ^A so that it is recognized as a local label.

	* as.c (perform_an_assembly_pass): zero bss_fix_root, too.

Fri Feb 21 01:08:48 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in, configure.in, doc: use the doc.  Build it, install
	  it, clean it, etc.

Tue Feb 18 02:21:25 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* read.c: white space and comments only.

	* configure.in: use the new atof-ns32.c for ns32k.

	* write.c: comment change only.

Mon Feb 17 07:51:06 1992  K. Richard Pixley  (rich at cygnus.com)

	* config/tc-ns32k.c: actually make tc_aout_fix_to_chars work
	  rather than abort.
				       
	* nearly everything.  flush ChangeLog, package as gas-1.92.1.
	  ChangeLog's prior to this are sketchy at best.  I have logs.
	  They just aren't ChangeLogs.
