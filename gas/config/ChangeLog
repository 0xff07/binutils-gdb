	* tc-m68k.h, te-sun3.h: moved LOCAL_LABELS_FB definition from
	  tc-m68k.h to te-sun3.h.

	* te-sun3.h: add LOCAL_LABELS_DOLLAR.

	* obj-aout.c: do not include stab.gnu.h if NO_LISTING.

	* tc-i860.c, a.out.gnu.h: move i860 relocs to a proper place.

	* a.out.h: removed.

	* tc-i386.c: tc-i386.c: added handling of the following opcodes:
	  i/o opcodes - inb, inw, outb and outw.  string manipulation with
	  att syntax - scmp, slod, smov, ssca, ssto.

	* obj-coff.c: (for aix386) Moved the symbols .text, .data and .bss
	  to just after .file .

	  In obj_crawl_symbol_chain() where it tries to put the external
	  symbols apart, with the condition:
	    (!S_IS_DEFINED(symbolP) &&
	     !S_IS_DEBUG(symbolP) &&
	     !SF_GET_STATICS(symbolP))
	  it was moving too many symbols out. So I switch it back to the
	  condition:
	    (S_GET_STORAGE_CLASS(symbolP) == C_EXT && !SF_GET_FUNCTION(symbolP))

	  In obj_emit_relocations() added the conditional on KEEP_RELOC_INFO
	  so that we don't use the F_RELFLG which make the linker complain
	  that somebody has stripped the relocation info.

	  Also, the AIX ld program require that the relocation table
	  is sorted by r_vaddr like the standard ATT assembler does.

	  [he also changed the sizeof(struct ...)'s into the coff
	  style FOOSZ macros.  I'm not sure this is right, but I can't
	  remember why.  xoxorich.]

	* tc-m88k.[hc]: pulled in from hack's unfinished work.  These
	  aren't yet integrated.

	* tc-i860.[hc]: blew off the dust.  Something must still be done
	  about conflicting relocation types.

	* tc-ns32k.c: Replaced previous tc_aout_fix_to_chars stub with the
	  real thing.

	* tc-i960.c, tc-sparc.c: white space and comments only.

	* tc-a29k.h: delete duplicate macro definition.

	* new file atof-ns32k.c copied from hack's last unreleased gas.
