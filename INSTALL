			GNU Development Tools
		       A Cygnus Support Release


This is the procedure for installing the a29k cross compiler on a
sun4.


0. Load the tape.

	If you haven't already done so, load the tape with:

		tar xvf /dev/rst8

	It doesn't really matter where, so long as the hard disk space
	is available.  The source for the tools will be loaded into
	./devo.

	The installed portion of the tools will take about 4 Mbytes of
	disk space.  Simply loading the source from tape will require
	about 32 Mbytes.  Loading the source from tape, building, and
	installing the tools will need about 46 Mbytes.

	Once loaded:

		cd devo

1. Create destdir.

	The default location for all installed files and programs is
	/usr/local.  We refer to this directory as $(destdir).  You
	can change $(destdir) only at configuration time.  This is
	because some tools have hard coded pathnames.

	If you change destdir after the tools are built, you will need
	to "make clean" and then rebuild.  If you don't understand
	this, you should probably be using the defaults for now.

	User visible programs are installed in $(destdir)/bin.  All
	other files and programs are installed in $(destdir)/lib/gcc.

	If $(destdir) does not already exist, create it now.

2. Configure the source.

	If you use the default $(destdir):

		configure +host=sun4 a29k

	Otherwise:

		configure +host=sun4 a29k +destdir=yourdestdir

	where "yourdestdir" should be the name of the $(destdir) that
	you've chosen.

3. Build and install the tools.

	Use:
		make install

	This will take about 20 minutes on an otherwise unloaded
	SparcStation 2 with a quick, sync, SCSI hard disk.

That's it.  You're done.  If you don't plan to hack these sources in
the near future, you'll probably want to also:

4. Remove intermediate object files.

		make clean

	and perhaps even:

		cd .. ; rm -rf devo


To use these tools, you will probably want to add $(destdir)/bin to
your path.  The tools are named with the standard UNIX(tm) names with
"-a29k" appended so as to avoid conflict with native development
tools.  That is, nm-a29k, etc.

For more information on usage, please refer to {LOTS OF VERY PRETTY
HARD COPY} (sic) that you should have received with your tape.
