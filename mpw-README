This is preliminary information about the Mac MPW port of the Cygnus tools.

To build everything, create an object directory, setdirectory into it, and do:

	::src:mpw-configure --target <name> --srcdir ::src: --prefix <whatever>

Then
	mpw-build all

will build everything, and

	mpw-build install

will install it.

KNOWN BUGS

ar rc xxx doesn't work.

objdump -i idiocy where it creates dummy files.

objcopy -O srec foo.o makes weird output filenames.

Mac host requires -mgas but Unix hosts don't.
