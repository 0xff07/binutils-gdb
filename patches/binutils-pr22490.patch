Subject: [PATCH] Properly handle note sections and segments

gABI specifies that notes should be aligned to 4 bytes in 32-bit objects
and to 8 bytes in 64-bit objects.  As a Linux extension, we support 4
byte alignment in 64-bit objects.  obj_elf_version and sco_id pad note
section to 4 byte alignment:

frag_align (2, 0, 0);

They should set section alignment to 4 bytes.  When dumping note sections,
if section alignment is less than 4, we treate alignment as 4 bytes to
handle note sections with incorrect section alignment.

readelf should also be able to dump CORE PT_NOTE segment, like

Displaying notes found at file offset 0x00000548 with length 0x00000cbc:
