	`move $s8, $sp' instruction.

Sat Jan  7 07:23:53 1995  Peter Schauer  (pes@regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de)

	* dbxread.c (process_one_symbol):  Handle N_FUN symbols
	for Sun acc 3.0 under SunOS4.

	Changes to improve handling of runtime common symbols
	under SunOS4.
	* minsyms.c (get_symbol_leading_char):  New routine to determine
	the leading symbol character for an objfile.
	(prim_record_minimal_symbol_and_info, install_minimal_symbols):
	Use it.
	* objfiles.h (rt_common_objfile):  New global, points to objfile
	containing the runtime common minimal symbols.
	* objfiles.c (free_objfile):  Mark rt_common_objfile as
	unallocated before freeing it.
	* solib.c (allocate_rt_common_objfile):  New routine to allocate
	an objfile for the runtime common minimal symbols.
	(solib_add_common_symbols):  Allocate an objfile for the runtime
	common symbols if necessary and put common symbols into it.
	Clean up code and comments.
	(solib_add, special_symbol_handling):  Cleanup comments regarding
	runtime common symbols.
	* stabsread.c (scan_file_globals_1):  New routine, contains
	old scan_file_globals code. Checks if there are any unresolved
	global symbols before starting the expensive minimal symbol table
	search.
	(scan_file_globals):  Now calls scan_file_globals_1 for the passed
	objfile and eventually for the runtime common objfile. Complains
	about any unresolved global symbols and removes them from the
	global symbol chain to avoid dangling pointers into the symbol
	table if the symbol table is reread.

Thu Jan  5 17:38:29 1995  Stu Grossman  (grossman@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (install_only uninstall):  Indent for clarity.

	* core.c (dis_asm_read_memory):  Add call to
	dis_asm_read_memory_hook to provide alternate way for disassembler
	to read memory.

	* defs.h:  Protect from multiple inclusion.  Add decl for
	dis_asm_read_memory_hook.

	* top.c:  Make window startup be the default.

	* gdbtk.c (finish_saving_output):  Don't do anything if not saving
	output.
	* (breakpoint_notify):  Don't send null filename to tcl.
	* (gdb_eval):  New tcl command to eval an expression.
	* (gdb_disassemble):  New tcl command to do disassembly.  This
	allows tcl code to choose between exec file and target memeory,
	and can also do mixed source and assembly.
	* (gdbtk_init):  Move reading of gdbtk.tcl to the end to make sure
	that more of the environment is set up.  Also, create link between
	gdb and tcl vars disassemble{-_}from{-_}exec.

	* gdbtk.tcl:  New expression window support.
	* Make assembly window be 80 columns wide.
	* Use new disassembly method.  Add menu items to select
	disassembly from exec file or target.
	* Change View menubar item to Options.

	* Get rid of Stack, Breakpoints, Signals, and Variables Windows,
	since they don't exist yet.

	* Pop up a copyright window on startup.

	* remote-os9k.c (rombug_wait): print message before register display
