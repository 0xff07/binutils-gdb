	* Makefile.in (install_only uninstall):  Indent for clarity

	* core.c (dis_asm_read_memory):  Add call to
	dis_asm_read_memory_hook to provide alternate way for disassembler
	to read memory.

	* defs.h:  Protect from multiple inclusion.  Add decl for
	dis_asm_read_memory_hook.

	* gdbtk.c (finish_saving_output):  Don't do anything if not saving
	output.
	* (breakpoint_notify):  Don't send null filename to tcl.
	* (gdb_eval):  New tcl command to eval an expression.
	* (gdb_disassemble):  New tcl command to do disassembly.  This
	allows tcl code to choose between exec file and target memeory,
	and can also do mixed source and assembly.
	* (gdbtk_init):  Move reading of gdbtk.tcl to the end to make sure
	that more of the environment is set up.  Also, create link between
	gdb and tcl vars disassemble{-_}from{-_}exec.

	* gdbtk.tcl:  New expression window support.
	* Make assembly window be 80 columns wide.
	* Use new disassembly method.  Add menu items to select
	disassembly from exec file or target.
	* Change View menubar item to Options.

	* Get rid of Stack, Breakpoints, Signals, and Variables Windows,
	since they don't exist yet.

	* Pop up a copyright window on startup.

	* top.c:  Make window startup be the default.
	* Add dis_asm_read_memory_hook.

	reference parameter passed in a register.

Wed Jan  4 12:27:29 1995  Kung Hsu  <kung@mexican.cygnus.com>

	* defs.h: move include tm.h up, so that the type LONGEST can
	also based on the target requirement to determine. In this case
	target mips64.

	* remote-os9k.c (rombug_open): catch exception e in rombug.
	* remote-os9k.c (rombug_wait): print message before register display
	from rombug.

	* ch-exp.y (literal):  Recognize NULL.
	(tuple):  Parse simple unlabelled tuples.
	* eval.c (evaluate_subexp case OP_ARRAY):  Use expect_type to
	evaluate brace-initializer-expressions depending on context.
	(evaluate_subexp case UNOP_CAST):  Pass the target type as
	expected type when evaluating the expression.

	* ch-typeprint.c (chill_type_print_base):  Get names of PTR and
	BOOL from TYPE_NAME.
	* ch-valprint.c (chill_print_type_scalar):  New function, to handle
	TYPE_CODE_RANGE better than print_type_scalar does.
	(chill_val_print_array_elements):  Use above new function.
