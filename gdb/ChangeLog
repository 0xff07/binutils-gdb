	* remote.c: Pacify --enable-build-warnings, reformat code
	to conform to standards, fix spelling errors.
	(ishex, stubhex, record_currthread, etc): Declare.
	(ishex, stubhex): Declare char arg as int.
	(pack_string): Comment out, never used but possibly useful.
	(threadref_to_int, remote_get_threadinfo, etc): Make static.

Wed Jan  6 11:43:32 1999  David Taylor  <taylor@texas.cygnus.com>

	The following changes were made by Elena Zannoni
 	<ezannoni@cygnus.com> and Edith Epstein <eepstein@cygnus.com> as
 	part of a project to merge in changes made by HP.

	* c-exp.y: use external flag hp_som_som_object_present to decide
 	whether code was compiled by HP's compilers.  Add two new C++
 	tokens for true and false.
        (yylex): check for template name is done differently for the
 	HP/aCC compiler case.  Change some of the template processing code
 	for handling HP aCC templates.  Handle true and false tokens.
	
Tue Jan  5 11:13:36 1999  Michael Snyder  <msnyder@cleaver.cygnus.com>

	* remote.c (record_curthread): Must not modify inferior_pid when
 	called from wait_for_inferior.  Instead, if a new thread-id is
 	detected, call add_thread.
	(MAGIC_NULL_PID): new macro, use instead of the magic number
 	"42000".
	(remote_find_new_threads): if inferior_pid is unknown, get and use
 	the current thread id.
	(remote_start_remote): on connecting, attempt to get the current
 	thread id for inferior_pid.
	(remote_resume): If pid == -1, then resume any-thread (not the
 	current thread specifically).  Also some cosmetic fixups.
	
	* thread.c (info_threads_command): don't initialize current_pid 
	until after call to FIND_NEW_THREADS (which may change inferior_pid).
	Also some cosmetic fixups.
	* infrun.c: cosmetic fixups and casts to avoid warnings.
	* infcmd.c: cosmetic fixups, mainly long lines.
	
Tue Jan  5 11:55:57 1999  David Taylor  <taylor@texas.cygnus.com>

	* target.c (noprocess): terminate sentence with a period.
	* breakpoint.c (catch_command_1): ditto.

	* c-valprint.c (c_value_print): remove hack^2 from HP; it causes
	testsuite losses with no real gain.

	* inferior.h (START_INFERIOR_TRAPS_EXPECTED): restore, but only
	if tm-*.h hasn't overridden default value.

1999-01-04  Jason Molenda  (jsm@bugshack.cygnus.com)

	* configure.in: Fix whitespace indentation for --help.
	* configure: Regenerated.

1999-01-04  Manuel Bouyer <bouyer@antioche.lip6.fr>

	* gdb.1: Document --write.

	* testsuite/Makefile.in: Ditto.

Mon Jan  4 12:53:03 1999  Stan Shebs  <shebs@andros.cygnus.com>

	* remote-vx.c (init_vx_ops, init_vx_run_ops): Remove unneeded
	inits of new fields, including ref to bogus field.
	(vx_ops, vx_run_ops): Make static.

Mon Jan  4 15:05:29 1999  David Taylor  <taylor@texas.cygnus.com>

	* inferior.h (START_INFERIOR_TRAPS_EXPECTED): delete,
	already defined in tm.h.

	* inftarg.c: change <sys/unistd.h> to <unistd.h> and
	conditionalize its inclusion.
	* infttrace.c: ditto.
