# .Sanitize for gdb/testsuite/config.

# Each directory to survive its way into a release will need a file
# like this one called "./.Sanitize".  All keyword lines must exist,
# and must exist in the order specified by this file.  Each directory
# in the tree will be processed, top down, in the following order.

# Hash started lines like this one are comments and will be deleted
# before anything else is done.  Blank lines will also be squashed
# out.

# All files listed between the "Things-to-keep:" line and the
# "Do-last:" line will be kept.  All other files will be removed.
# Directories listed in this section will have their own Sanitize
# called.  Directories not listed will be removed in their entirety
# with rm -rf.
