	* gdb.t00/default.exp, gdb.t01/run.exp, gdb.t02/whatis.exp,
	gdb.t03/ptype.exp, gdb.t06/break.exp, gdb.t12/scope.exp: Added
	expected failures for mips-idt-* and mips-sgi-*.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp (attach): Kill process if requested.
	* gdb.t00/help.exp (help target core, help target): Accept a gdb
	that does not read core files.
	* gdb.t01/run.exp: Removed checks for exit status code.
	* gdb.t03/in-gdbme.c: Make explicit call to malloc to ensure that
	it is linked in.
	* gdb.t03/ptype.exp: Increase timeout when calling malloc.
	* gdb.t04/setvar.exp, gdb.t05/expr.exp: Use runto function where
	appropriate, rather than doing it by hand.
	* gdb.t07/watchpoint.exp: If mips-idt-*, reload file after first
	execution.
	* gdb.t10/crossload.exp: Kill existing program if needed.
	* gdb.t15/funcargs.exp: Use delete_breakpoints function where
	appropriate, rather than doing it by hand.  Always increase
	timeout for this test, not just for VxWorks.

	**** start-sanitize-chill ****
	* gdb.t31/chillvars.exp (test_structs):  New proc to test printing
	of Chill STRUCT types and STRUCT values.
	* gdb.t31/chillvars.exp (test_strings):  Expect "CHAR" now, rather
	than "char".
	* gdb.t31/in-gdbme.ch (simple_struct, nested_struct, struct1,
	struct2):  New struct definitions and initializations to test 
	simple Chill STRUCT types.

	* gdb.t00/teststrategy.exp:  Track reversion in gdb to not print
	the null byte at the end of strings.
	* gdb.t00/default.exp:  Make show version insensitive to copyright
	date.
	* gdb.t16/in-gdbme.c (ctable1, ctable2):  Make explicitly unsigned
	to avoid dependencies on target char signedness.
	* gdb.t16/printcmds.exp:  Update expected results for explicitly
	unsigned char.
	* gdb.t16/printcmds.exp:  Remove setup_xfails for i960 that should
	now work.
	* gdb.t21/demangle.exp:  Add many more patterns for template
	demangling, most of them being expected failures.
	* gdb.t21/demangle.exp (proc demangle):  Quote the demangled
	string we are matching for, to match on the whole string.
	* gdb.t21/demangle.exp:  Add many new test strings to demangle,
	and fix a whole bunch that had incorrect expected output but were
	passing anyway because of the bug in "proc demangle".
	**** start-sanitize-chill ****
	* gdb.t31/chillvars.exp:  Remove setup_xfail for printing string
	type.
	* gdb.t31/in-gdbme.ch:  Uncomment string4, now compiles.

        * gdb/testsuite: made modifications to testcases, etc., to allow
        them to work properly  given the reorganization of deja-gnu and the
        relocation of the testcases from deja-gnu to a "tool" subdirectory.

Sun Feb 21 10:55:55 1993  Mike Werner  (mtw@poseidon.cygnus.com)

	* gdb/testsuite: Initial creation of gdb/testsuite.
	Migrated dejagnu testcases and support files for testing nm to
	gdb/testsuite from deja-gnu.  These files were moved "as is"
	with no modifications.  This migration is part of a major overhaul
	of dejagnu.  The modifications to these testcases, etc., which
	will allow them to work with the new version of dejagnu will be
	made in a future update.
